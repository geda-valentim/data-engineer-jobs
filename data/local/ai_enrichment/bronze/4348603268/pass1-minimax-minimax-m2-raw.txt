<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me go through each section systematically.

First, let me identify what information is explicitly stated in the job posting:

**Title**: Data Engineer-Business Intelligence
**Company**: IBM
**Location**: Hyderabad, Telangana, India

Now let me go through each field in the JSON structure:

1. **compensation**: No salary information is mentioned, so all compensation fields should be null/false.

2. **work_authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. No security clearance mentioned either.

3. **work_model**: The location is "Hyderabad, Telangana, India" which suggests onsite work, but I need to check if remote/hybrid is mentioned. Looking at the description, it mentions "client's environment" and working with teams, but doesn't explicitly state remote/hybrid/onsite. The location is given as a specific city, so this would be "onsite" but I should be careful - the location is stated but the work model isn't explicitly described. Let me check again... No explicit mention of remote, hybrid, or onsite work model. The employment type isn't explicitly stated either.

4. **contract_details**: No contract type, duration, or other contract details mentioned.

5. **contractor_rates**: No contractor rates mentioned.

6. **skills_classified**: This is where I need to be very careful about the classification rules.
