<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting step by step to infer the job characteristics based on the Pass 1 extraction results and the original job posting.

Looking at the original job posting:
- Title: Data Engineer-Business Intelligence
- Company: IBM
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- This is for IBM Consulting Client Innovation Centers

Key details from the job posting:
- 3+ years experience required
- Master's degree preferred
- Cognos Developer & Admin required
- BI/DW projects experience
- UNIX knowledge required
- Cloud platforms mentioned as nice to have (AWS, Google, Azure)
- ETL tools mentioned as nice to have
- On-site work model in Pune, India

Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- The role requires "minimum of 3 years of experience"
- Title is "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" (not "Senior" or "Junior")
- 3 years is typically mid-level for data engineering
- No explicit seniority indicators in title
- This suggests "mid" level (confidence around 0.7)

### job_family
- Title clearly indicates "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence"
- Core focus is on BI, reporting, visualization
- This maps to "bi_engineer" (Business Intelligence Engineer)
- Very clear from title and responsibilities (confidence 0.9+)

### sub_specialty
- Focus on BI, reporting, visualization using Cognos
- Data warehouse projects mentioned
- This is clearly "bi_engineer" specialty
- Not streaming, not general data engineering
- Focus on business intelligence and reporting (confidence 0.85)

### leadership_expectation
- No mention of team leadership, mentoring, or direct reports
- Individual contributor role focused on development and maintenance
- No leadership responsibilities mentioned
- This suggests "ic" (pure IC, no leadership) (confidence 0.8)

## STACK AND CLOUD


I'll analyze the cloud infrastructure and technical requirements. The role shows a multi-cloud approach with flexibility. AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure are all mentioned as potential platforms, indicating a "multi" cloud strategy. The processing will likely involve batch data processing, given the BI and reporting focus. No specific orchestration tools are highlighted, suggesting a standard approach to data pipeline management. The storage layer appears to be a data warehouse, consistent with business intelligence and reporting requirements.

## GEO AND WORK MODEL
The position has clear geographical constraints. Pune, Maharashtra, India is the specified location, indicating a "same_country" restriction. The timezone focus is clearly India-based, with no indication of global or multi-timezone collaboration. Relocation isn't required since the role is already based in Pune.

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION
The job posting lacks explicit visa sponsorship details. With no clear indication of visa support, I'll infer a conservative stance. The role seems to require standard work authorization, without specific international hiring preferences. The absence of clear visa information suggests a neutral approach to work authorization.

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION
The employment structure appears traditional. A full-time position likely means a W2 employment type. Benefits aren't explicitly mentioned, which typically indicates a standard compensation package without extraordinary perks.

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT
Career progression signals are minimal. The role suggests limited growth opportunities, with no explicit mentorship or promotion pathways. The position appears focused on individual contributor responsibilities without clear advancement mechanisms.

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION
The job requirements show a balanced approach. There's a clear distinction between mandatory and preferred qualifications, indicating a moderate level of requirement strictness. The role scope is well-defined, targeting a specific BI engineer profile without unnecessary complexity.
