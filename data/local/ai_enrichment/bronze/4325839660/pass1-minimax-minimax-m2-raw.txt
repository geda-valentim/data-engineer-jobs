<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me go through each section systematically.

First, let me identify what information is explicitly stated in the job posting:

**Title**: Data Engineer
**Company**: Quest Global
**Location**: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India

**Compensation**: No salary information is mentioned, so salary_disclosed = false, all salary fields = null

**Work Authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization, or citizenship requirements. So visa_sponsorship_stated = "not_mentioned", work_auth_text = null, citizenship_text = null, security_clearance_stated = "not_mentioned"

**Work Model**: No mention of remote/hybrid/onsite work model. employment_type is not explicitly stated as full-time, contract, etc. So work_model_stated = "not_mentioned", location_restriction_text = null, employment_type_stated = "not_mentioned"

**Contract Details**: No contract information mentioned. So contract_type = "not_mentioned", all other contract fields = null

**Contractor Rates**: No contractor rates mentioned. So pay_type = "not_mentioned", all other contractor fields = null

**Skills Classification**: Let me analyze the skills mentioned:

From the job description:
- "Strong proficiency in MySQL, Python or PowerShell scripting" - This is a strong qualifier, so these are must-have skills
- "Hands-on experience in SharePoint online/ 2016/ 2019, Power Platforms (PowerApps and Power automate)" - "Hands-on" is a strong qualifier, so these are must-have
- "Web page development knowledge (HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, React/Angular, REST, API's etc)" - "Knowledge" without strong qualifier, but this seems to be required for the role
- "Knowledge of Databricks is an added advantage" - "Added advantage" is a weak qualifier, so this is nice-to-have
 
I'll focus on the soft skills and experience requirements. The role demands strong communication abilities and a proven track record of meeting tight deadlines. The position requires 3-6 years of relevant professional experience, with a preference for candidates holding a bachelor's degree in computer science or engineering. The educational requirement is explicitly stated as preferred, not mandatory.

The technical skills span multiple domains: database management with MySQL, programming in Python and PowerShell, SharePoint platform expertise, and web development technologies like HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript. Additionally, knowledge of Databricks is considered a valuable supplementary skill.

The role emphasizes a hybrid skill set that bridges data management and digital collaboration tools, requiring professionals who can develop scalable and user-friendly solutions across various technological domains.

Key responsibilities include developing and optimizing data pipelines, creating Tableau dashboards, designing SharePoint sites, and building custom web applications using diverse technologies like Python, .NET, and Node.js. The position demands strong technical proficiency and the ability to integrate enterprise systems while maintaining robust documentation and compliance standards.

The ideal candidate will have 3-6 years of experience in Python, MySQL, SharePoint, web application development, and Tableau, with excellent communication skills and the ability to work with large, varied datasets and meet strict delivery timelines.

The company culture emphasizes diversity, inclusion, and empowering individuals to make a positive difference across industries. They value unique perspectives and backgrounds, believing that diverse ideas are crucial for solving complex engineering challenges.

Quest Global prioritizes creating an intentional workplace culture that enables employees to contribute meaningfully, fostering an environment where different voices are heard and valued.
