<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what I have:

1. Original job posting: Data Engineer-Data Platforms-Google at IBM in Hyderabad, India
2. Pass 1 extraction results with various fields extracted

Now I need to go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
Looking at the job posting:
- Title: "Data Engineer-Data Platforms-Google" 
- The role mentions "Associate Software Developer" in the description
- Responsibilities include implementing models, designing applications, leading teams
- Required experience: Database migration, Hadoop to GCP conversion, API development
- Preferred experience includes more advanced topics like Elasticsearch, Splunk, ML

The title has "Data Engineer" but the description mentions "Associate Software Developer". The responsibilities seem quite senior - leading teams, designing enterprise applications, implementing complex data systems. However, the "Associate" title suggests this might be more mid-level.

Looking at the must-have skills: Database migration, Hadoop to GCP conversion, API development, team leadership - these are quite advanced. The preferred skills include ML techniques, predictive modeling, etc.

I think this is more of a senior level role despite the "Associate" title, because:
- Team leadership mentioned
- Enterprise application design
- Complex technical requirements
- Migration and modernization work

Confidence: 0.7 (moderate inference from responsibilities)

### job_family
Title is "Data Engineer" and the core responsibilities are around data gathering, storage, processing, database integration, API development. This is clearly a data engineer role.

Confidence: 0.95 (very clear from title and responsibilities)

### sub_specialty
Looking at the responsibilities:
- "both batch and real-time processing"
- "database integration and untangle complex, unstructured data sets"
- "Implementing and validating predictive models"
- "Designing and implementing various enterprise search applications such as Elasticsearch and Splunk"
- "Develop/Convert the database (Hadoop to GCP)"
- "Implementation of a specific Data Replication mechanism (CDC, file data transfer, bulk data transfer, etc.)"
 
The role encompasses multiple data engineering domains. The position requires expertise in both batch and real-time processing, suggesting a hybrid approach to data management. The focus spans cloud migration, data replication, and advanced search technologies, indicating a comprehensive data engineering specialization.

Confidence: 0.8 (strong inference from multiple processing types mentioned)

### leadership_expectation
The role explicitly mentions:
- "Leads the team to adopt right tools"
- "Collaborating closely with diverse teams"
- "partnering with other scientists, engineers, consultants and database administrators"

This suggests technical leadership without direct reports mentioned. It's more of a tech lead IC role.

Confidence: 0.75 (inferred from team leadership mentions)

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
The job posting explicitly mentions:
- "Develop/Convert the database (Hadoop to GCP)"
- GCP is mentioned multiple times as the target platform

This is clearly GCP-focused.

Confidence: 0.95 (explicitly mentioned)

### secondary_clouds
Only GCP is mentioned. No other cloud providers are referenced.

Confidence: 0.9 (no other clouds mentioned)

### processing_paradigm
The posting mentions:
- "both batch and real-time processing"
- "Data Replication mechanism (CDC, file data transfer, bulk data transfer, etc.)"

This clearly indicates both batch and streaming capabilities.

Confidence: 0.85 (explicitly mentions both batch and real-time)

### orchestrator_category
No specific orchestrator is mentioned in the job posting. The responsibilities mention Agile methodology but no specific orchestration tools.

Confidence: 0.3 (too low, should be "not_mentioned")

### storage_layer
The posting mentions:
- "Hadoop to GCP conversion"
- "Data Replication mechanism"
- "database (Hadoop to GCP)"

This suggests moving from Hadoop (data lake) to GCP (which could be BigQuery warehouse or Cloud Storage). The mention of Hadoop suggests data lake patterns, but GCP conversion could go either way.

Confidence: 0.6 (moderate inference, could be lake or warehouse)

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
The job posting states:
- Location: "Hyderabad, Telangana, India"
- "ext_work_model_stated": "onsite"
- "ext_location_restriction_text": "Hyderabad, Telangana, India"

This is clearly onsite in Hyderabad, India.

Confidence: 0.95 (explicit location and onsite requirement)

### timezone_focus
The location is Hyderabad, India, which would be IST (Indian Standard Time). This is in the APAC region.

Confidence: 0.9 (clear from location)

### relocation_required
The job is specifically for Hyderabad, India and is onsite. This suggests you need to be in Hyderabad already or willing to relocate there.

Confidence: 0.8 (inferred from onsite requirement in specific location)

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
The job is in India, so H1B (US visa) is not relevant. The posting doesn't mention visa sponsorship.

Confidence: 0.9 (not applicable for India location)

### opt_cpt_friendly
Again, this is for India, so US student visas (OPT/CPT) are not relevant.

Confidence: 0.9 (not applicable for India location)

### citizenship_required
The job is in India, so it would require work authorization in India, but the posting doesn't specify citizenship requirements.

Confidence: 0.5 (vague, not clearly stated)

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
The job is at IBM, a large corporation, and is "full_time" employment type. This suggests W2 employment.

Confidence: 0.85 (inferred from full-time corporate role)

### benefits_level
The Pass 1 extraction shows "ext_benefits_mentioned": [] (empty array), "ext_equity_mentioned": false, etc. No benefits are mentioned in the posting.

Confidence: 0.9 (no benefits mentioned)

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
The job posting doesn't mention career paths, growth opportunities, or advancement. It's focused on the technical responsibilities.

Confidence: 0.9 (no career development mentioned)

### mentorship_signals
The posting mentions "partnering with other scientists, engineers, consultants and database administrators" but doesn't specifically mention mentorship or working with senior people for learning.

Confidence: 0.4 (too low, should be "not_mentioned")

### promotion_path_mentioned
No mention of promotion, advancement, or career growth paths.

Confidence: 0.9 (no promotion mentions)

### internal_mobility_mentioned
No mention of internal transfers or role changes.

Confidence: 0.9 (no mobility mentions)

### career_tracks_available
No career tracks mentioned at all.

Confidence: 0.9 (no career tracks mentioned)

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
Looking at the Pass 1 extraction:
- ext_must_have_hard_skills: 13 skills listed
- ext_nice_to_have_hard_skills: 10 skills listed
- The language includes "Required Technical And Professional Expertise" and "Preferred Technical And Professional Experience"

This shows a clear distinction between required and preferred skills, suggesting medium strictness.

Confidence: 0.75 (clear must-have vs nice-to-have distinction)

### scope_definition
The job posting is focused on data engineering with specific technical responsibilities around data platforms, migration, and processing. It's not trying to combine multiple roles.

Confidence: 0.85 (clear, focused data engineering role)

### skill_inflation_detected
The role requires advanced skills like database migration, Hadoop to GCP conversion, API development, team leadership. The title suggests "Associate" but the requirements are quite senior. However, these skills are reasonable for a senior data engineer role, not inflated.

Confidence: 0.8 (reasonable skill set for the level)

Let me now format this into the required JSON structure.
