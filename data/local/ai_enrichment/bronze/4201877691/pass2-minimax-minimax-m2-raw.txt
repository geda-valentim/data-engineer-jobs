<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting for a BI Data Engineer position at UNFCU. I need to go through each inference category systematically.

First, let me understand the role:
- Title: BI Data Engineer
- Company: UNFCU (United Nations Federal Credit Union)
- Location: Queens, NY
- Salary: $105,000 - $140,000 annually
- Work model: Hybrid
- Experience: 6+ years required

Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
The job requires 6+ years of experience and mentions "Regardless of seniority or role" which suggests this could be at different levels. However, the 6+ years requirement and the complexity of responsibilities (data migration, data warehousing, performance optimization, dimensional modeling) suggests this is at the senior level. The title is "BI Data Engineer" without "Senior" in it, but the experience requirement and responsibilities point to senior level.

Confidence: 0.75 - This is a moderate inference based on 6+ years experience and complex responsibilities.

### job_family
The title is "BI Data Engineer" and the core responsibilities are around building data intensive applications, data migration, data warehousing, and BI tools. This is clearly a data engineering role with BI focus.

Confidence: 0.95 - Very clear from title and responsibilities.

### sub_specialty
The role focuses heavily on:
- Data warehousing and data lakes
- ETL processes (SSIS)
- BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, OBIEE, SSRS)
- Database technologies (SQL Server, Oracle)
- Data migration

This is primarily batch ETL and data warehousing focused, with BI/reporting components.

Confidence: 0.85 - Strong inference from the tools and responsibilities mentioned.

### leadership_expectation
The role mentions working with team members, analysts, product managers, and business users, but there's no mention of direct reports, hiring, or people management responsibilities. 

The role involves technical collaboration and requirement gathering, but lacks explicit people management duties. The position appears to be a technical individual contributor role with cross-functional interaction, focusing on data engineering and BI solutions without direct supervisory responsibilities.

Confidence: 0.80 - Clear from the responsibilities described.

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
The job posting mentions Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and various Microsoft tools (SSIS, SSRS, Power BI), but doesn't mention any specific cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP. This appears to be an on-premise or hybrid environment focused on traditional database technologies.

Confidence: 0.90 - Strong inference from the Microsoft/Oracle stack mentioned.

### secondary_clouds
No cloud providers are mentioned at all, so this would be an empty array.

Confidence: 0.95 - Very clear from the text.

### processing_paradigm
The role mentions ETL tools (SSIS), data warehousing, and scheduled processes, but doesn't mention real-time streaming or event-driven architectures. This appears to be primarily batch processing focused.

Confidence: 0.80 - Strong inference from ETL and warehousing focus.

### orchestrator_category
The role mentions working with "multiple environments for development, testing, and deploying in production" and "change control and testing processes", but doesn't specifically mention orchestration tools like Airflow, Luigi, or similar. The focus seems to be more on database development and BI tools rather than pipeline orchestration.

Confidence: 0.70 - Moderate inference, some orchestration implied but not explicit.

### storage_layer
The role mentions "Data Warehouse", "Data Lakes", and "Data Lake House" explicitly. It also mentions dimensional models and SSAS cubes. This suggests a mixed approach with both warehouse and lake technologies.

Confidence: 0.85 - Strong inference from explicit mentions.

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
The role is hybrid and based in Queens, NY. There's no mention of remote work restrictions or requirements for specific timezones. The location is fixed (Queens, NY) but the hybrid model provides some flexibility.

Confidence: 0.75 - Moderate inference from hybrid model and fixed location.

### timezone_focus
The role is based in Queens, NY, which would be Eastern Time. However, there's no explicit mention of timezone requirements or expectations for working hours.

Confidence: 0.60 - Low to moderate inference, location suggests EST but not explicitly stated.

### relocation_required
The role is based in Queens, NY and is hybrid. Since it's a local position with no mention of relocation assistance or requirements, this suggests relocation is not required (candidates should already be in the area).

Confidence: 0.80 - Strong inference from the local nature of the role.

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
The job posting doesn't mention visa sponsorship at all. In the "What We're Seeking" section, there's no mention of work authorization requirements or visa support.

Confidence: 0.70 - Moderate inference from lack of mention (could go either way).

### opt_cpt_friendly
Similar to H1B, there's no mention of student visa support or work authorization requirements for international students.

Confidence: 0.65 - Moderate inference from lack of mention.

### citizenship_required
The posting mentions "UNFCU is an equal opportunity employer" and discusses non-discrimination, but doesn't specify citizenship requirements. The general statement about considering applicants without regard to various characteristics suggests work authorization is the main requirement.

Confidence: 0.75 - Moderate inference from the equal opportunity language.

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
The role is described as "full_time" employment and mentions benefits like training and development programs, which strongly suggests W2 employment rather than contractor (1099) or corp-to-corp arrangements.

Confidence: 0.90 - Strong inference from full-time and benefits mention.

### benefits_level
The role mentions:
- Training, conferences, seminars
- Credit Union training and development programs
- Learning budget (inferred from training/conferences)

This suggests a standard to comprehensive benefits package, but not unlimited PTO or equity (since it's a credit union, likely not equity-based).

Confidence: 0.80 - Strong inference from the benefits mentioned.

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
The posting mentions "professional growth" in the company description and "training, conferences and seminars" but doesn't provide specific career paths or advancement tracks. This is more implied growth rather than explicit career ladders.

Confidence: 0.70 - Moderate inference from general growth mentions.

### mentorship_signals
The role mentions working with team members including analysts, product managers, and business users, but doesn't specifically mention mentorship programs or working with senior engineers for learning purposes.

Confidence: 0.60 - Low inference, some collaboration mentioned but no mentorship focus.

### promotion_path_mentioned
There's no explicit mention of promotion paths, advancement opportunities, or career progression within the role description.

Confidence: 0.90 - Strong inference from lack of mention.

### internal_mobility_mentioned
No mention of internal transfers, lateral moves, or exploring different roles within the organization.

Confidence: 0.90 - Strong inference from lack of mention.

### career_tracks_available
The posting doesn't mention specific career tracks like IC track, management track, etc. It's focused on the current role rather than future paths.

Confidence: 0.60 - Low inference, no tracks mentioned.

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
The role has a clear list of "must have" requirements (6+ years experience, specific tools, etc.) and some "nice to have" items (Oracle PL/SQL, TFS, DBA activities, etc.). This suggests medium strictness - clear requirements but also some flexibility.

Confidence: 0.80 - Strong inference from the clear distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves.

### scope_definition
The role is clearly defined as a BI Data Engineer position with specific responsibilities around data warehousing, BI tools, and database development. It's not a multi-role hybrid position.

Confidence: 0.90 - Strong inference from focused job description.

### skill_inflation_detected
The requirements seem reasonable for a senior-level data engineer role:
- 6+ years experience
- Database and BI tool expertise
- ETL experience
- Communication skills

The skill set aligns well with the seniority level and experience requirements.

Confidence: 0.85 - Strong inference that requirements are appropriate for the level.
