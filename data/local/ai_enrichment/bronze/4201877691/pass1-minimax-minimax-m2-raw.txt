<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting for a BI Data Engineer position at UNFCU. Let me go through each section systematically.

First, let me identify the key information:

**Title/Company/Location:**
- Title: BI Data Engineer
- Company: UNFCU
- Location: Queens, NY

**Compensation:**
- Salary Range: $105,000 - $140,000 annually

- salary_currency = "USD" (since it's $)
- salary_period = "yearly"
- salary_text_raw = "NYC Salary Range - $105,000 - $140,000 annually"

**Work Authorization:**
- I need to look for any mentions of visa sponsorship, work authorization, citizenship requirements
- Looking through the text... I don't see any explicit mentions of visa sponsorship or work authorization requirements
- There's a mention of "UNFCU prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type. All applicants will be considered for employment without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by country, federal, state or local laws."

- security_clearance_stated = "not_mentioned"

**Work Model:**
- "This position is expected to be hybrid" - explicitly stated

- contract_type = "not_mentioned"
- All other contract fields = null

**Contractor Rates:**
- This is a full-time position with salary, not contractor rates
