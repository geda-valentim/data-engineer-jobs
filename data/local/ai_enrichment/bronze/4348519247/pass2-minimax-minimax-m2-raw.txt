<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics. I need to go through each field systematically.

First, let me understand what I'm working with:

1. **Original Job Posting**: This is for a "Data Scientist-Advanced Analytics" role at IBM in Bengaluru, India. However, the description talks about being a "Data Engineer" which seems inconsistent with the title.

2. **Pass 1 Extraction**: This gives me structured data about the role.

Let me analyze each inference field:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
Looking at the job posting, the title is "Data Scientist-Advanced Analytics" but the description says "As an Data Engineer at IBM..." This is confusing. The responsibilities mention implementing predictive models, statistical models, big data, machine learning techniques, enterprise search applications like Elasticsearch and Splunk. There's no mention of years of experience required. The skills mentioned (POC development, AI solutions, Gen AI, etc.) seem quite advanced. Given that this is at IBM and involves advanced analytics, AI, and enterprise systems, this seems like it could be a senior-level role. However, the lack of explicit experience requirements makes it hard to be certain. I'll go with "senior" based on the complexity and scope of responsibilities.

### job_family
The title says "Data Scientist" but the description repeatedly refers to "Data Engineer". The responsibilities include data gathering, storage, batch and real-time processing, database integration, unstructured data sets, implementing predictive models, statistical models, enterprise search applications. This is a mix of data scientist and data engineer responsibilities. However, the emphasis on data infrastructure, processing, and systems suggests this is primarily a data engineer role with some data science elements. I'll classify this as "data_engineer" since that's what the description emphasizes.

### sub_specialty
The role mentions both batch and real-time processing, enterprise search applications (Elasticsearch, Splunk), database integration, unstructured data. This suggests a focus on data processing and integration rather than a specific specialty like ML ops or data governance. 

I'll categorize this as a general data engineering role with broad technical capabilities across different data processing domains.

### leadership_expectation
The description doesn't mention any direct reports, team management, or leadership responsibilities. It talks about collaborating with diverse teams but doesn't indicate any formal leadership role. This appears to be an individual contributor position focused on technical execution rather than people management.

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
The job posting doesn't mention any specific cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP. There's no mention of cloud services, cloud platforms, or cloud-specific technologies. This suggests either an on-premise environment or a cloud-agnostic approach. I'll classify this as "not_mentioned" since no cloud provider is specified.

### secondary_clouds
Since no primary cloud is mentioned, there are no secondary clouds either. Empty array.

### processing_paradigm
The description explicitly mentions "both batch and real-time processing". This clearly indicates a hybrid approach to data processing. The role involves handling different types of data processing workflows, suggesting flexibility in processing methods.

### orchestrator_category
No specific orchestration tools are mentioned. There's no reference to Airflow, Spark, dbt, or other workflow management systems. The description focuses on data processing and model implementation but doesn't specify how these processes are orchestrated or scheduled.

### storage_layer
The job posting doesn't mention specific storage systems like data warehouses, data lakes, or lakehouse architectures. There's no reference to Snowflake, Redshift, S3, or other storage technologies. This suggests the storage layer is not a primary focus or is not specified in the job description.

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
The location is specified as "Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India" and the work model is "onsite". This indicates a specific geographic requirement with no remote work flexibility. The role requires physical presence in the designated location.

### timezone_focus
The job is located in India, specifically Bengaluru, which falls under the India Standard Time (IST) timezone. This suggests the role will primarily operate within the Asia-Pacific (APAC) timezone region.

### relocation_required
The onsite requirement implies that candidates must already be based in Bengaluru or be willing to relocate to this specific location. The job posting doesn't explicitly mention a relocation package, but the onsite mandate suggests relocation is necessary.

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
The job posting doesn't mention H1B visa sponsorship. Given that this is an Indian role at an Indian location, H1B sponsorship would not be relevant. The role is clearly targeted for candidates already authorized to work in India.

### opt_cpt_friendly
Similar to H1B, OPT/CPT would not apply to an Indian location. The job posting doesn't mention any specific visa or work authorization requirements for international students.

### citizenship_required
The job posting doesn't specify any citizenship requirements. It's likely open to any candidates authorized to work in India, without specific citizenship restrictions.

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
The job posting doesn't specify the employment type. As an IBM role in India, it's likely a full-time employment arrangement, but the exact contract type isn't explicitly mentioned.

### benefits_level
No specific benefits are mentioned in the job posting. This could range from standard corporate benefits to a more comprehensive package, but without explicit details, it's difficult to determine the exact level.

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
The job posting doesn't provide clear information about career progression or growth opportunities. There's no mention of specific career tracks, promotion paths, or professional development programs.

### mentorship_signals
No explicit mentorship programs or opportunities are mentioned in the job description. The role involves collaboration with diverse teams, but doesn't specifically highlight mentorship as a key component.

### promotion_path_mentioned
The job posting doesn't mention any specific promotion or advancement opportunities. There's no indication of how employees might progress within the organization or role.

### internal_mobility_mentioned
No information about internal mobility or opportunities to explore different roles within the company is provided in the job posting.

### career_tracks_available
The job posting doesn't specify available career tracks. Without clear information about potential career paths, it's challenging to determine what tracks might be accessible.

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
The job posting presents a mix of required and preferred qualifications. There are specific technical skills mentioned as necessary, while some experience with programming languages like COBOL and JAVA is listed as preferred. This suggests a moderate level of requirement strictness.

### scope_definition
The job description appears focused on data engineering and advanced analytics, with clear responsibilities related to data processing, model implementation, and technical solution development. The scope seems well-defined and specific to the role.

### skill_inflation_detected
The required skills align with the senior-level nature of the position. The combination of AI, machine learning, and data engineering competencies appears appropriate for an advanced analytics role, without indicating unrealistic or inflated skill expectations.
