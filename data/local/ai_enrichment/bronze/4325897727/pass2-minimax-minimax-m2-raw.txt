<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting:**
- Title: Data Engineer-Business Intelligence
- Company: IBM
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- This is for IBM Consulting Client Innovation Centers
- Focus on BI/DW projects, reporting and visualization using Cognos
- 3+ years experience required
- Education: MCA/M.Tech/B.Tech/B.E.
- Skills: Cognos Developer & Admin, UNIX, cloud platforms (AWS, Google, Azure), ETL tools

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- No salary disclosed
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No work model specified
- No location restrictions mentioned
- No employment type specified
- Must-have skills: Cognos Developer, Admin, UNIX
- Nice-to-have skills: AWS, Google, Azure, IBM InfoSphere DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica PowerCenter
- Must-have soft skills: Communication, Time Management
- 3 years minimum experience
- Education: Bachelor's required
- No benefits mentioned
- No equity mentioned
- No learning budget mentioned

Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" (no explicit senior/junior in title)
- Experience: 3 years minimum
- This suggests mid-level (not entry, not senior)
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8 (title doesn't specify, but 3 years suggests mid-level)
- Value: "mid"

### job_family
- Title explicitly says "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence"
- Focus on BI/DW projects, reporting and visualization
- This is clearly a BI Engineer role
- Confidence: 0.9+ (explicit in title)
- Value: "bi_engineer"

### sub_specialty
- Focus on reporting and visualization using Cognos


- ETL/Data Integration tools mentioned
- This is primarily BI/reporting focused
- Confidence: 0.8 (clear BI focus)
- Value: "bi_engineering" (but this isn't in the allowed values... let me check)
- Looking at allowed values: "streaming_realtime" | "batch_etl" | "data_warehouse" | "data_lakehouse" | "ml_infra" | "mlops" | "data_governance" | "data_quality" | "data_modeling" | "cloud_migration" | "reverse_etl" | "api_development" | "observability" | "general" | "not_mentioned"
- This would be "data_warehouse" or "general" - I'll go with "data_warehouse" since it's BI/DW focused

### leadership_expectation
- No mention of mentoring, leading teams, or direct reports
- Focus on individual contributor work
- Confidence: 0.8 (no leadership signals)
- Value: "ic"

I'll analyze the cloud and processing aspects, noting the multi-cloud approach and batch processing focus. The role emphasizes data warehousing and business intelligence, with a clear preference for experienced professionals in the mid-level range. The position requires strong technical skills in Cognos and UNIX, with additional expertise in cloud platforms and ETL tools being advantageous.

The role appears to be a standard individual contributor position without explicit leadership expectations, targeting professionals with 3+ years of experience in data engineering and business intelligence domains.

Cloud infrastructure shows flexibility across AWS, Google, and Azure, suggesting a multi-cloud strategy. The processing approach centers on batch ETL, with no real-time streaming requirements mentioned. Orchestration tools are not specified, indicating a potential need for further clarification about workflow management.

Storage layer remains undefined, requiring additional investigation to understand the underlying data architecture and management approach.

Geographic constraints reveal a specific location requirement in Pune, Maharashtra, India, with no explicit remote work options. Timezone focus appears to be India-specific, though precise details are not yet confirmed.

Visa and work authorization requirements are currently unspecified, necessitating direct inquiry about potential sponsorship or work permit support.

Contractual details suggest a standard employment arrangement, likely full-time, though specific terms remain unclear. Benefits appear minimal or not comprehensively outlined.

Career development signals are limited, with no explicit growth opportunities, mentorship programs, or internal mobility pathways currently indicated. The role seems to have a narrowly defined scope focused on BI engineering, without significant skill inflation concerns.

The position requires careful verification of work authorization, particularly for international candidates, as current details suggest potential restrictions.
