<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me go through each section systematically.

First, let me identify what information is explicitly stated in the job posting:

**Job Details:**
- Title: Data Engineer-Business Intelligence
- Company: IBM
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India

**Compensation:**
- No salary information mentioned → salary_disclosed: false, all salary fields null

**Work Authorization:**
- No mention of visa sponsorship or work authorization requirements → visa_sponsorship_stated: "not_mentioned"

**Work Model:**

- No employment type mentioned → employment_type_stated: "not_mentioned"

**Contract Details:**
- No contract type mentioned → contract_type: "not_mentioned"
- No contract duration mentioned → contract_duration_months: null
- No start date mentioned → start_date: "not_mentioned"

**Contractor Rates:**
- No contractor rates mentioned → pay_type: "not_mentioned"

**Skills Classification:**
Let me analyze the skills mentioned:

**Required Technical And Professional Expertise:**
- "Cognos Developer & Admin Required" → This is explicitly stated as required, so must_have_hard_skills: ["Cognos Developer", "Admin"]
- "Experience: The resource should have a minimum of 3 years of experience of working in the in BI DW projects in areas pertaining to reporting and visualization using cognos" → years_experience_min: 3, years_experience_max: null, years_experience_text: "minimum of 3 years"
- "He shall have good understanding of UNIX" → must_have_hard_skills: ["UNIX"]

**Preferred Technical And Professional Experience:**

- "should be well conversant in English and should have excellent writing, MIS, communication, time management and multi-tasking skill" → must_have_soft_skills: ["Communication", "Time Management"]

**Education:**
- "Master's Degree" in Preferred Education section → education_level: "MASTERS"
- "The resource should be full time MCA/M. Tech/B. Tech/B.E. and should preferably have relevant certifications" → This is confusing as it mentions both Master's and Bachelor's degrees. 

I'll focus on the most specific requirement. The job posting emphasizes a full-time educational background in technology, with a preference for relevant certifications. The minimum qualification appears to be a Bachelor's degree in a technology-related field, with a Master's degree being preferred.

The educational requirements suggest a strong technical foundation, with flexibility in the specific undergraduate degree. Relevant certifications are highlighted as an additional advantage for candidates.

- Team info: "Develop and maintain a strong working relationship with business and technical members of the team" → team_info_text: [this text]

**AI/ML Technologies:**
- No mention of LLMs, GenAI, or feature stores → llm_genai_mentioned: false, feature_store_mentioned: false

Let me now structure this into the JSON format.
