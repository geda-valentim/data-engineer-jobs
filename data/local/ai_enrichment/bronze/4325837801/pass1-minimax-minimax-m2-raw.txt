<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me go through each section systematically.

Looking at the job posting:
- Title: Application Developer-Process Management (BPM)
- Company: IBM
- Location: Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India

Let me extract information section by section:

1. **Compensation**: No salary information is mentioned in the job posting, so all compensation fields should be null/false.

2. **Work Authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. So this should be "not_mentioned" with null text.

3. **Work Model**: 
   - Location is specified as "Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India" - this suggests onsite work
   - No mention of remote or hybrid work options
   - No mention of employment type (full-time, contract, etc.)
   - So work_model_stated should be "onsite" since location is specified
   - employment_type_stated should be "not_mentioned"

4. **Contract Details**: No mention of contract type, duration, etc. So all should be "not_mentioned" or null.

5. **Contractor Rates**: No mention of contractor rates, so all should be "not_mentioned" or null.

6. **Skills Classification**: This is the most complex section. Let me analyze:

Looking at the requirements:

I'll focus on the communication skill, which is a soft skill.
