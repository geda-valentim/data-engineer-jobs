<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting step by step to infer the job characteristics.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting Analysis:**
- Title: "Data Engineer-Data Platforms" at IBM
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- This is for IBM Consulting Client Innovation Centers (Delivery Centers)
- 6+ years experience required, 4+ years with Python and Spark
- Master's degree preferred
- Must have: Python, Spark, PySpark, debugging, root cause analysis
- Nice to have: AWS, GCP, Azure
- Focus on Content Management backend software system

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- No salary disclosed
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No work model specified
- No location restrictions mentioned
- No employment type specified
- Must have: Python, Spark, PySpark, debugging, root cause analysis
- Nice to have: AWS, GCP, Azure
- 6+ years experience required
- Master's degree preferred
- No benefits mentioned
- No security clearance mentioned

Now let me go through each inference category:

**1. SENIORITY AND ROLE:**

**seniority_level:**
- Title: "Data Engineer-Data Platforms" (no explicit senior/junior in title)
- Experience: 6+ years overall, 4+ years with Python and Spark
- Responsibilities: "manage end to end feature development", "resolve challenges", "debugging, finding root cause analysis"
- This suggests someone who can work independently and handle complex issues
- 6+ years is typically senior level in data engineering
- Confidence: 0.75 (moderate inference from experience + responsibilities)

**job_family:**
- Title clearly states "Data Engineer"
- Core responsibilities involve Python, Spark, PySpark for data processing
- Focus on "feature development" and "Content Management backend software system"
- This is clearly a data engineering role
- Confidence: 0.95 (very clear from title and responsibilities)

**sub_specialty:**
- Mentions Spark, PySpark (batch processing)
- No specific streaming technologies mentioned


- No specific data warehouse/lake mentions
- Focus seems to be on general data engineering with Spark
- This would be "general" or "batch_etl" specialty
- Confidence: 0.65 (moderate inference from Spark focus)

**leadership_expectation:**
- Responsibilities include "manage end to end feature development"
- Mentions "resolve challenges faced in implementing"
- No mention of direct reports or team management
- This suggests technical leadership without people management
- "tech_lead_ic" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.70 (moderate inference from responsibilities)

I'll focus on the leadership expectations, noting the role requires technical oversight without direct team management. The position demands someone who can independently drive feature development and solve complex technical challenges, positioning it as a technical lead individual contributor role.

**2. STACK AND CLOUD:**

**primary_cloud:**
- Nice to have mentions AWS, GCP, Azure
- No specific cloud services mentioned
- No clear primary cloud provider
- This suggests "multi" cloud approach or "not_mentioned"
- Since all three major clouds are mentioned as nice to have, "multi" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.75 (moderate inference from multiple cloud mentions)

**secondary_clouds:**
- Since primary is "multi", secondary would be empty array
- Confidence: 0.80

**processing_paradigm:**
- Mentions Spark, PySpark
- No streaming technologies mentioned (no Kafka, Kinesis, Flink)
- Focus on "feature development" and "debugging"
- This suggests batch processing
- "batch" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.70 (moderate inference from Spark focus)

**orchestrator_category:**
- No specific orchestrator mentioned (no Airflow, etc.)
- Mentions Spark job scheduling
- "spark_native" could apply
- But no clear evidence, so "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.60 (low confidence, but lean toward not_mentioned)

**storage_layer:**
- No specific data warehouse or lake mentioned
- Focus on Spark processing
- No clear storage layer mentioned
- "not_mentioned" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.70

**3. GEO AND WORK MODEL:**

**remote_restriction:**
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- No specific remote work model mentioned
- No location restrictions mentioned
- This suggests "not_mentioned" for remote restrictions
- Confidence: 0.80

**timezone_focus:**
- Location: Pune, India
- No specific timezone requirements mentioned
- No team distribution mentioned
- "not_mentioned" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.75

**relocation_required:**
- Location is specified as Pune, Maharashtra, India
- No mention of relocation
- Since location is specified, this suggests people need to be in Pune
- But this isn't really "relocation required" - it's more about location preference
- "false" seems appropriate (no explicit relocation requirement)
- Confidence: 0.75

**4. VISA AND AUTHORIZATION:**

**h1b_friendly:**
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- Location is India, but this is for a role in India
- No US work authorization mentioned
- "not_mentioned" or could infer false since no sponsorship mentioned
- Since this is for India location, H1B doesn't apply
- "false" with high confidence since H1B is US-specific and role is in India
- Confidence: 0.90

**opt_cpt_friendly:**
- No mention of student visas or OPT/CPT
- No work authorization requirements mentioned
- "not_mentioned" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.80

**citizenship_required:**
- No citizenship requirements mentioned
- No work authorization requirements mentioned
- "not_mentioned" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.80

**5. CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION:**

**w2_vs_1099:**
- No employment type mentioned
- No contract type mentioned
- This is for IBM, which typically offers full-time positions
- But no explicit mention
- "not_mentioned" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.70

**benefits_level:**
- No benefits mentioned at all
- "none_mentioned" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.90

**6. CAREER DEVELOPMENT:**

**growth_path_clarity:**
- Mentions "limitless career path with the world's technology leader"
- But no specific career tracks mentioned
- This is quite vague - just generic career growth language
- "vague" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.65

**mentorship_signals:**
- No specific mentorship program mentioned
- Mentions "Learn new technologies" but no mentorship
- No mention of working with senior people
- "not_mentioned" seems appropriate
- Confidence: 0.80

**promotion_path_mentioned:**

- Confidence: 0.75

**7. REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION:**

**requirement_strictness:**
- Clear must-haves vs nice-to-haves distinction
- Must have: Python, Spark, PySpark, debugging, root cause analysis
- Nice to have: AWS, GCP, Azure
- This suggests "medium" strictness
- Confidence: 0.75

**scope_definition:**
