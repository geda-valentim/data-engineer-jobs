<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules. Let me go through each section systematically:

1. **COMPENSATION**: The job posting doesn't mention any salary information, so all compensation fields should be null.

   - Location is "Kochi, Kerala, India" - this suggests onsite work
   - No mention of remote or hybrid work
   - No mention of employment type (full-time, contract, etc.)
   - So work_model_stated should be "onsite" based on the location
