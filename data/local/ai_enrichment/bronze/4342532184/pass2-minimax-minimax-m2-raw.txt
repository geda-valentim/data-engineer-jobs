<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics based on the Pass 1 extraction results and the original job posting.

First, let me understand what this job is:
- Title: Data Scientist (Contract)
- Company: Counterpart
- Location: São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil
- This is a contract position for a data scientist role

Let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
Looking at the requirements:
- 3+ years of experience as a data scientist, data analyst or machine learning
- 5+ years experience with Python
- Experience training machine learning models that have been deployed to execute business decisions

This suggests someone with substantial experience. 3+ years as a data scientist plus 5+ years with Python suggests this is likely a mid to senior level role. Given the experience requirements and the fact they're building production models and working with business stakeholders, this seems like a "senior" level role.

Confidence: 0.8 - Strong inference from experience requirements

### job_family
The title is "Data Scientist" and the description focuses heavily on:
- Machine learning model development
- Data science techniques
- Statistical analysis
- Business insights

This is clearly a data scientist role, not a data engineer or other role.

Confidence: 0.95 - Very clear from title and responsibilities

### sub_specialty
Looking at the responsibilities:
- Predict insurance claims using data science techniques
- Support production of new data sources (web scraping, APIs)
- Maintain clean production environment for data models
- Present work to technical and non-technical stakeholders

This seems to be focused on predictive modeling/analytics rather than specific technical infrastructure. The mention of web scraping and APIs suggests some data engineering aspects, but the core focus is on data science and modeling.

This would be "general" data science or possibly "ml_infra" since they're dealing with production models.

Confidence: 0.7 - Moderate inference

### leadership_expectation
The description mentions:
- "Build and support a team of data scientists and analysts to accelerate our learnings"


- Collaborate with insurance domain experts and engineering teams
- Present findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

I see a role that requires significant cross-functional collaboration. The position involves guiding a team, working across different domains, and communicating complex insights to diverse audiences. This suggests a leadership-oriented data scientist who bridges technical and business perspectives, with responsibilities extending beyond individual contributor work.

The role demands strategic thinking, team development, and the ability to translate technical findings into actionable business recommendations. It's a position that requires both deep technical expertise and strong interpersonal skills.

The cloud infrastructure appears flexible, with no specific provider explicitly defined. The team seems to prioritize meeting coordination across US time zones, indicating a distributed work model that values collaboration despite geographical spread.

The role's location restrictions are precise, limited to six specific Latin American countries, with no indication of relocation requirements. Work authorization appears to be the primary constraint, suggesting openness to local talent within the designated regions.

Visa and sponsorship details remain unspecified, with no explicit mention of H1B or other visa support. The employment structure is clearly defined as a fixed-term contract, though specific duration details are not provided.

Compensation details suggest a standard contractor arrangement, with salary-based pay and no immediate indication of equity participation. The benefits package appears minimal, reflecting typical contractor limitations.

Career development opportunities seem limited, with no explicit growth path or mentorship programs mentioned. The role appears focused on immediate project delivery rather than long-term professional advancement.

Requirements suggest a moderate level of technical complexity, with clear skill expectations and a well-defined scope of work. The position demands solid technical competencies without excessive specialization.

The skill set appears balanced, with realistic expectations for a mid-level professional. No significant red flags emerge regarding skill inflation or unrealistic demands.
