<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics based on the Pass 1 extraction results and the original job posting.

First, let me understand what I'm working with:

1. **Original Job Posting**: This is for a "Quality Engineer-Packages" role at IBM in Bengaluru, India. However, the description seems to be about a Data Engineer role, which is confusing. The title says "Quality Engineer" but the responsibilities are clearly about data engineering, machine learning, and software development.

2. **Pass 1 Extraction**: Shows this is an onsite role in Bengaluru, India, with 6-7 years total experience required (4-5 relevant), Master's degree preferred, and various technical skills required.

Let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Pass 1 shows 6-7 years total experience (4-5 relevant)
- The role involves complex responsibilities like implementing predictive models, designing enterprise search applications, working with big data
- This suggests a senior level role
- Confidence: 0.8 (6-7 years + complex responsibilities)

### job_family
- The description is clearly about data engineering work
- Mentions data pipelines, ETL, database integration, big data processing
- Pass 1 shows data engineering skills like Azure Databricks, PySpark, SQL, etc.
- This is clearly a data_engineer role
- Confidence: 0.95

### sub_specialty
- The role mentions both batch and real-time processing
- Has ETL, data integration, big data focus
- This suggests batch_etl as the primary specialty
- Confidence: 0.75

### leadership_expectation
- The role mentions collaborating with teams but doesn't mention direct reports or management responsibilities
- It's focused on technical work like implementing models, building pipelines
- This suggests "ic" (individual contributor) role
- Confidence: 0.8

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
- Pass 1 shows "Azure Databricks", "Azure Devops", "Azure Blob" as mandatory skills


- Clearly Azure-focused
- Confidence: 0.95

### secondary_clouds
- No other cloud providers mentioned
- Empty array
- Confidence: 0.9

### processing_paradigm
- The description mentions both "batch and real-time processing"
- This is clearly hybrid
- Confidence: 0.9

### orchestrator_category
- No specific orchestrator mentioned in the description
- Pass 1 doesn't show any orchestrator tools
- This would be "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.8

### storage_layer
- Mentions Azure Databricks which typically works with data warehouses
- No specific storage layer mentioned
- This would be "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.7

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
- Pass 1 shows "onsite" work model
- Location is "Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India"
- This suggests "same_region" (specific city/region required)
- Confidence: 0.9

### timezone_focus
- Location is India, so this would be "specific_country" (India)
- Confidence: 0.9

### relocation_required
- Role is onsite in Bengaluru
- No mention of relocation package or requirement to move
- Since it's already location-specific, this would be false
- Confidence: 0.8

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
- Pass 1 shows "ext_visa_sponsorship_stated": "not_mentioned"
- No mention of H1B sponsorship
- This would be false
- Confidence: 0.8

### opt_cpt_friendly
- No mention of student visas or OPT/CPT
- This would be false
- Confidence: 0.7

### citizenship_required
- No citizenship requirements mentioned
- This would be "work_auth_only"
- Confidence: 0.7

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
- This appears to be a full-time employee role at IBM
- No contract type mentioned
- This would be "w2"
- Confidence: 0.8

### benefits_level
- Pass 1 shows "ext_benefits_mentioned": []
- No benefits mentioned
- This would be "none_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.9

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
- No career path or growth opportunities mentioned
- This would be "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.9

### mentorship_signals
- Mentions "collaborative environment" and working with diverse teams
- No specific mentorship program mentioned
- This would be "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.8

### promotion_path_mentioned

### internal_mobility_mentioned
- No internal mobility mentioned
- This would be false
- Confidence: 0.9

### career_tracks_available
- No career tracks mentioned
- Empty array
- Confidence: 0.9

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
- Pass 1 shows many "must_have_hard_skills" (14 skills listed)
- These are marked as "Mandatory Skills"
- This suggests high strictness
- Confidence: 0.85

### scope_definition
- The role has a clear focus on data engineering
- Despite the confusing title, the responsibilities are well-defined
- This would be "clear"
- Confidence: 0.8

### skill_inflation_detected
- 6-7 years experience for this level of responsibility seems reasonable
- Skills listed are appropriate for the role
- This would be false
- Confidence: 0.8

Let me compile this into the JSON format.
