Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" (no "Senior" or "Junior" prefix)
- Experience: 3+ years minimum
- This suggests mid-level (3-5 years typically mid-level)
- No "Senior" in title, but 3+ years suggests more than entry level
- Confidence: 0.7 (title doesn't specify but experience suggests mid-level)
- Value: "mid"

### job_family
- Title explicitly says "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence"
- Focus on BI/reporting/visualization using Cognos
- This is clearly a BI-focused data engineer role
- Confidence: 0.95 (explicit in title)
- Value: "bi_engineer"

### sub_specialty
- Focus on Business Intelligence, reporting, visualization


- ETL tools mentioned (DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica)
- This suggests batch ETL and data warehouse focus
- Confidence: 0.8 (inferred from BI focus and ETL tools)
- Value: "batch_etl"

### leadership_expectation
- No mention of team leadership, mentoring, or direct reports
- Role appears to be individual contributor focused
- Confidence: 0.9 (no leadership signals)
- Value: "ic"

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
- Multiple clouds mentioned: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure
- No clear primary cloud specified
- Confidence: 0.8 (multiple clouds, no primary)
- Value: "multi"

### secondary_clouds
- Since primary is "multi", secondary would be empty
- Confidence: 0.9
- Value: []

### processing_paradigm
- ETL tools mentioned (DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica PowerCenter)
- Focus on reporting and visualization
- No streaming technologies mentioned
- Confidence: 0.8 (batch ETL focus)
- Value: "batch"

### orchestrator_category
- No specific orchestrator mentioned
- ETL tools suggest data integration workflows
- Confidence: 0.5 (too low, use "not_mentioned")
- Value: "not_mentioned"

### storage_layer
- Focus on BI/reporting suggests data warehouse
- Cognos is typically used with data warehouses
- Confidence: 0.7 (inferred from BI focus)
- Value: "warehouse"

I'll analyze the geographic and work model characteristics, focusing on the location and potential work arrangements. The role is based in Pune, Maharashtra, India, which suggests a specific regional context for this data engineering position. The lack of explicit remote work details means I'll need to make careful inferences about potential work flexibility.

The timezone focus appears to be India-specific, with no clear indication of broader regional or global work requirements. This suggests a localized approach to the role's temporal demands.

Regarding visa and work authorization, the position seems to have standard employment requirements. The lack of specific visa sponsorship language implies a standard work authorization process, likely requiring existing work eligibility in India.

The employment type appears to be a standard full-time position, with no indication of contract or specialized employment arrangements. Benefits seem minimal or not explicitly discussed, suggesting a basic employment package.

Career development signals are limited, with no clear growth path or mentorship opportunities mentioned. The role appears to be a straightforward technical position without significant advancement prospects.

Requirements suggest a moderate level of technical expertise, with a clear but not overly complex skill set. The scope is well-defined, focusing on Business Intelligence and data engineering without unnecessary complexity.

The skill requirements appear reasonable for the specified experience level, with no significant red flags or unrealistic expectations.
