<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting Analysis:**
- Title: "BI - SR Data Engineer" (Senior Data Engineer)
- Company: IT4W (Business Intelligence company, Microsoft partner)
- Location: Arkansas, United States
- Language: Spanish (with some English terms)
- Focus: Business Intelligence, data architecture, ETL development
- Tech stack: Microsoft Fabric, Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Power BI, SQL, Python, DAX
- Work model: Hybrid or remote
- Benefits: Comprehensive package mentioned

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- Work model: hybrid
- Location: Arkansas, United States
- Employment type: full_time
- Contract type: permanent
- Must-have skills: data architecture design, ETL development, Microsoft Fabric, Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Power BI, SQL, Python, DAX
- Nice-to-have skills: continuous improvement, process optimization, scalable architecture practices, data governance
- Benefits: Comprehensive list including competitive salary, hybrid/remote work, health insurance, vacation, training, etc.
- Learning budget: mentioned
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No equity mentioned
- PTO policy: generous

Now let me infer each field according to the rules:

**Seniority and Role:**
- seniority_level: "SR Data Engineer" clearly indicates senior level (confidence 0.9+)
- job_family: This is clearly a data_engineer role focused on BI and ETL (confidence 0.9+)
- sub_specialty: Focus on batch ETL and data warehouse/lakehouse (confidence 0.8+)
- leadership_expectation: Senior role with client interaction, but no mention of direct reports (tech_lead_ic, confidence 0.7+)

**Stack and Cloud:**
- primary_cloud: Microsoft Azure heavily mentioned (Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Microsoft Fabric) - confidence 0.9+


- secondary_clouds: No other clouds mentioned - empty array
- processing_paradigm: ETL development suggests batch processing primarily - confidence 0.8+
- orchestrator_category: Azure Data Factory mentioned - cloud_native - confidence 0.9+
- storage_layer: Both Lakehouse and Warehouse mentioned - mixed - confidence 0.8+

I'll continue analyzing the geographic and work model characteristics. The role appears to have specific location constraints in Arkansas, with a hybrid work approach. The timezone focus seems to be centered on the United States, with no specific regional restrictions beyond the state requirement. The work model suggests flexibility between remote and in-person collaboration.

Regarding visa and authorization, the position requires standard work authorization without specific sponsorship details. The employment structure indicates a traditional W2 full-time arrangement with a comprehensive benefits package.

Career development opportunities seem promising, with implied growth potential and a collaborative environment. The role appears to offer professional development through technical training and strategic project participation, though specific promotion paths aren't explicitly defined.

The requirements suggest a balanced approach, with clear technical expectations and a focus on data engineering expertise. The role demands strong technical skills in data architecture and ETL development, balanced with interpersonal capabilities for client interaction.
