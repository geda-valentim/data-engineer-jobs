<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting for ActBlue's Senior Data Engineer II position. Let me go through each section systematically.

First, let me identify the key information:

**Title and Company:**
- Title: Senior Data Engineer II
- Company: ActBlue
- Location: United States

**Compensation:**
- Salary Range: $173,676 - $192,209 - $210,741
- This appears to be a salary range, so salary_disclosed = true
- salary_min = 173676, salary_max = 210741
- salary_currency = "USD" (since it's $)
- salary_period = "yearly" (typical for full-time positions)
- salary_text_raw = "Salary Range: $173,676 - $192,209 - $210,741"

**Work Authorization:**
- "ActBlue is unable to sponsor work visas at this time."
- This means visa_sponsorship_stated = "will_not_sponsor"
- work_auth_text = "ActBlue is unable to sponsor work visas at this time."

**Work Model:**
- "This posting is for a full-time, remote, salaried position"
- work_model_stated = "remote"
- employment_type_stated = "full_time"
- location_restriction_text = "Registered States*: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Washington D.C."

**Contract Details:**
- "full-time, remote, salaried position" → contract_type = "permanent"
- No specific contract duration mentioned → contract_duration_months = null
- No extension or conversion mentioned → extension_possible = "not_mentioned", conversion_to_fte = "not_mentioned"
- No specific start date mentioned → start_date = "not_mentioned"
 
I'll analyze the contractor rates, focusing on the salary structure and employment details. The position is a full-time salaried role with no specific contractor rate information. The compensation appears to be a fixed annual salary, with no indication of hourly or project-based payment.

The skills classification reveals a comprehensive technical profile. The role demands extensive Python expertise, with strong requirements in data engineering and backend development. Key technical competencies include data architecture, distributed systems, and machine learning workflow deployment. The position requires significant professional experience, specifically 5+ years in data engineering or backend development.

The educational background suggests a preference for advanced technical degrees, though the specific field remains unspecified. The role emphasizes practical, hands-on experience over formal academic credentials.

Geographically, the position is limited to US-based candidates, with specific state restrictions. The benefits package is robust, offering comprehensive healthcare, generous leave policies, and professional development support. The company demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being through flexible work arrangements and extensive benefit options.

The organizational context highlights a mission-driven approach, focusing on supporting Democratic campaigns and progressive causes through innovative technology solutions.
