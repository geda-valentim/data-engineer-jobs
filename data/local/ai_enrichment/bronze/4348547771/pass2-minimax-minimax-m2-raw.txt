<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics based on the Pass 1 extraction results and the original job posting.

Looking at the original job posting:
- Title: Application Developer-Process Management (BPM)
- Company: IBM
- Location: Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India
- The role is described as "Data Engineer" in the description but the title is "Application Developer-Process Management (BPM)"

Key points from the job posting:
1. It's about BPM (Business Process Management) tools
2. Requires 3+ years of Appian software development experience
3. Database knowledge required (Oracle SQL, MySQL)
4. BPM tools experience (IBM BPM, Pega, Camunda)
5. Business process automation
6. API and web services integration
7. ERP/CRM integration
8. Onsite in Bengaluru, India
9. Full-time permanent position

Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- The role requires 3+ years of experience minimum, with 5-7 years preferred for BPM
- This suggests mid to senior level
- The title is "Application Developer" which is typically mid-level
- But the description calls it "Data Engineer" which could be senior
- Given the experience requirements (3-7 years), this seems like a mid-level role
- Confidence: 0.7 (moderate inference from experience requirements)

### job_family
- The title is "Application Developer-Process Management (BPM)"
- The description mentions "Data Engineer" but the core focus is on BPM tools and process automation
- This is clearly a BPM/Process Management role, not traditional data engineering
- The skills are focused on Appian, BPM tools, database integration
- This would be "data_engineer" but with a BPM specialty
- Confidence: 0.8 (strong inference from title and responsibilities)

### sub_specialty
- The role is focused on BPM (Business Process Management)


- Specific tools include IBM BPM, Pega, Camunda
- This is about process automation and workflow management
- This would be "general" since it's BPM-focused but not specifically streaming, batch, etc.
- Confidence: 0.7 (inferred from BPM focus)

### leadership_expectation
- No mention of team leadership, mentoring, or direct reports
- Focus is on individual contributor work
- This suggests pure IC role
- Confidence: 0.8 (inferred from lack of leadership mentions)

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
- No specific cloud providers mentioned
- No AWS, Azure, GCP services mentioned
- Focus is on BPM tools and databases
- This would be "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.9 (no cloud mentions at all)

### secondary_clouds
- No clouds mentioned, so empty array
- Confidence: 0.9

### processing_paradigm
- Mentions both batch and real-time processing in the description
- "harness the power of data to unveil captivating stories and intricate patterns. You'll contribute to data gathering, storage, and both batch and real-time processing"
- This clearly indicates "hybrid"
- Confidence: 0.8 (explicit mention of both batch and real-time)

### orchestrator_category
- No specific orchestration tools mentioned
- No Airflow, Spark, dbt, etc.
- This would be "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.9

### storage_layer
- Mentions databases (Oracle SQL, MySQL)
- No specific data warehouse, lake, or lakehouse mentioned
- This would be "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.8

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
- Location: "Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India"
- Work model: "onsite"
- This suggests "same_country" (India only)
- Confidence: 0.9 (explicit location and onsite requirement)

### timezone_focus
- Location is Bengaluru, India
- This would be "specific_country" (India)
- Confidence: 0.9

### relocation_required
- Already requires being in Bengaluru
- This suggests relocation might be needed if not already there
- But the wording suggests they want someone already in the area
- This is ambiguous - could be true (need to relocate to Bengaluru) or false (already there)
- I'll go with false since it says "must be resident" in Pass 1
- Confidence: 0.7

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
- Pass 1 shows "ext_visa_sponsorship_stated": "not_mentioned"
- No mention of visa sponsorship
- This would be false (not mentioned = not available typically)
- Confidence: 0.8

### opt_cpt_friendly
- No mention of student visas
- Work authorization mentioned but not specific about student visas
- This would be false
- Confidence: 0.7

### citizenship_required
- Pass 1 shows "ext_residency_requirement": "must_be_resident"
- This suggests work authorization only, not citizenship
- "work_auth_only"
- Confidence: 0.8

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
- Pass 1 shows "ext_employment_type_stated": "full_time"
- "ext_contract_type": "permanent"
- This suggests W2 employment
- "w2"
- Confidence: 0.8

### benefits_level
- Pass 1 shows "ext_benefits_mentioned": []
- No benefits mentioned at all
- "none_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.9

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
- No mention of career paths, growth opportunities, or advancement
- "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.9

### mentorship_signals
- Mentions "Collaborating closely with diverse teams" but no specific mentorship
- No formal mentorship program mentioned
- "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.8

### promotion_path_mentioned
- No mention of promotion or advancement

- Confidence: 0.9

### internal_mobility_mentioned
- No mention of internal transfers or role changes
- false
- Confidence: 0.9

### career_tracks_available
- No career tracks mentioned
- Empty array
- Confidence: 0.9

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
- Clear distinction between "Required Technical And Professional Expertise" and "Preferred Technical And Professional Experience"
- Mix of must-haves and nice-to-haves
- This suggests "medium"
- Confidence: 0.7

### scope_definition
- Focused job description on BPM/Process Management
- Single clear role, well-defined responsibilities
- "clear"
- Confidence: 0.8

### skill_inflation_detected
- 3-7 years experience for BPM role seems reasonable

- Confidence: 0.8
