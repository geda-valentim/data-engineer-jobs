<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me go through each section systematically.

First, let me identify what information is explicitly stated in the job posting:

**Title**: Data Consultant-Data Governance
**Company**: IBM
**Location**: Pune, Maharashtra, India

**Description sections**:
- Introduction about working in IBM Consulting Client Innovation Centers
- Role and Responsibilities as Data Engineer
- Preferred Education: Master's Degree
- Preferred Technical And Professional Expertise (seems to be cut off)

Now let me extract each field systematically:

**Compensation**: No salary information is mentioned, so all compensation fields should be null.

**Work Authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. So this should be "not_mentioned" for visa_sponsorship_stated and null for the text fields.

**Work Model**: 
- Location is explicitly stated as "Pune, Maharashtra, India" - this suggests onsite work
- Employment type is not explicitly mentioned, but given it's a full-time consulting role, I should check if "full_time" is mentioned
- Looking at the text, I don't see explicit "full_time" mentioned, so employment_type_stated should be "not_mentioned"
- work_model_stated should be "onsite" since a specific location is given

**Contract Details**: No mention of contract type, duration, etc. So all should be null or "not_mentioned".

**Contractor Rates**: No mention of contractor rates, so all should be null or "not_mentioned".

**Skills Classification**: Let me analyze the skills mentioned:
