<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting step by step to infer the required characteristics.

First, let me understand what I'm working with:

1. **Original Job Posting**: Data Engineer-Business Intelligence role at IBM in Pune, Maharashtra, India
2. **Pass 1 Extraction**: Contains structured data about the role

Let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" (no "Senior" in title)
- Experience: "minimum of 3 years of experience"
- Responsibilities: Analysis, requirements gathering, design, coordination, customization, testing, support of reports
- This seems like a mid-level role (3 years experience, but not "Senior" in title)
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8 range

### job_family
- Title explicitly says "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence"
- Core responsibilities: BI/DW projects, reporting, visualization
- This is clearly a data engineer role with BI focus
- Confidence: 0.9+

### sub_specialty
- Focus on BI/DW projects, reporting, visualization
- Mentions Cognos (BI tool)
- ETL/Data Integration tools mentioned
- This is BI/reporting focused, so "general" or "data_modeling" would fit
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8

### leadership_expectation
- No mention of team leadership, mentoring, or direct reports
- Focus on individual contribution: analysis, development, maintenance
- This is pure IC role
- Confidence: 0.8+

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud

- This appears to be batch processing for BI/reporting
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8

### orchestrator_category
- No specific orchestrator mentioned
- Mentions ETL tools like IBM InfoSphere DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica PowerCenter
- These are more ETL tools than orchestrators
- Confidence: 0.5 (low, so "not_mentioned")

- Confidence: 0.8+

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION
