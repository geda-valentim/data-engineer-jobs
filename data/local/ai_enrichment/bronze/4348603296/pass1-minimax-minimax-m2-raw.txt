<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me go through the job posting systematically:

**Job Title**: Data Engineer-Data Platforms
**Company**: IBM
**Location**: Pune, Maharashtra, India

Let me analyze each section:

1. **Compensation**: No salary information is mentioned in the job posting, so all compensation fields should be null.

2. **Work Authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. Should be "not_mentioned".

3. **Work Model**: The location is specified as "Pune, Maharashtra, India" but there's no explicit mention of remote/hybrid/onsite work model. Since it's a specific location, I should check if this implies onsite work. The posting doesn't explicitly state the work model, so it should be "not_mentioned".

4. **Contract Details**: No mention of contract type, duration, or employment terms. Should be "not_mentioned" for contract_type and null for other contract fields.

5. **Contractor Rates**: No mention of contractor rates or pay structure. Should be "not_mentioned" for pay_type and null for other rate fields.

6. **Skills Classification**: Let me analyze the skills mentioned:

**Must-have hard skills** (based on strong qualifiers):
- "Strong Hands on experience in Python and Spark" - this has "Strong" qualifier
- "Strong technical abilities to understand, design, write and debug to develop applications on Python and Pyspark" - this has "Strong" qualifier

**Nice-to-have hard skills** (based on weak qualifiers):
