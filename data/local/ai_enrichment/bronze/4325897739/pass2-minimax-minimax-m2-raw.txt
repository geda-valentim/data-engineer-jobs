Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
The job posting says "Data Engineer" with "Minimum 4+ years of experience in Big Data technologies". This suggests a senior level position. In data engineering, 4+ years typically maps to senior level. The title doesn't have "Senior" in it, but the experience requirement is substantial. Confidence: 0.75 (moderate inference from responsibilities and experience)

### job_family
This is clearly a "data_engineer" - the title is "Data Engineer" and the responsibilities are all about building data pipelines, processing data, etc. Confidence: 0.95 (very clear from title and responsibilities)

### sub_specialty
Looking at the skills and responsibilities:
- "Experience in developing streaming pipelines"


- "Exposure to streaming solutions and message brokers like Kafka technologies"
- "Apache Spark, Kafka, any Cloud computing etc"

The role emphasizes streaming and real-time data processing. With Kafka and streaming pipelines as core technologies, this points to a specialized focus on real-time data engineering. The cloud-native approach using Azure further reinforces the streaming and real-time data processing specialization. Confidence: 0.85 (strong inference from streaming technologies mentioned)

### leadership_expectation
The job description focuses on technical implementation without mentioning team management or direct reports. It emphasizes individual contributor responsibilities like developing and maintaining data solutions. The role appears to be a pure technical position without explicit leadership requirements. Confidence: 0.80 (clear from lack of management mentions)

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
Multiple Azure-specific services are highlighted, including Azure Data Factory, Synapse, and HDInsight. The consistent mention of Azure technologies indicates a strong cloud platform preference. Confidence: 0.95 (explicit Azure focus)

### secondary_clouds
The job description concentrates solely on Azure, with no references to other cloud providers like AWS or GCP. This suggests a single-cloud strategy. Confidence: 0.90 (no other clouds mentioned)

### processing_paradigm
The role emphasizes streaming capabilities through Kafka and real-time pipeline development. This points to a streaming-oriented approach to data processing. Confidence: 0.85 (strong streaming emphasis)

### orchestrator_category
While specific orchestrators aren't explicitly named, the cloud-native services like Azure Data Factory suggest a preference for cloud-based workflow management. The absence of traditional tools like Airflow indicates a modern, cloud-centric approach. Confidence: 0.75 (inferred from cloud services)

### storage_layer
The job description references multiple storage technologies, including Hadoop, HDFS, and NoSQL databases like HBase. This indicates a mixed storage approach, combining traditional and modern data storage solutions. Confidence: 0.80 (diverse storage technologies mentioned)

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
The position is explicitly limited to Kochi, Kerala, India, with an onsite work model. This represents a strict geographic constraint requiring local presence. Confidence: 0.95 (clear location restriction)

### timezone_focus
The India-specific location implies a focus on the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, with local timezone considerations. Confidence: 0.90 (specific country mentioned)

### relocation_required
The onsite requirement in Kochi suggests potential relocation needs for candidates not already in the area. However, the specific language about relocation isn't explicitly stated. Confidence: 0.70 (inferred from onsite requirement)

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
No visa sponsorship information is provided, which typically indicates limited visa support for international candidates. Confidence: 0.85 (no sponsorship mentioned)

### opt_cpt_friendly
The lack of specific visa information suggests potential restrictions for students or temporary workers. The onsite requirement might further limit visa flexibility. Confidence: 0.75 (inferred from lack of visa details)

### citizenship_required
The job appears to require work authorization, but doesn't specify citizenship requirements. This suggests openness to various work authorization types. Confidence: 0.80 (work authorization implied)

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
The position seems to be a standard full-time employee role, likely with a W2 employment structure given the corporate consulting context. Confidence: 0.85 (standard employee position)

### benefits_level
No specific benefits are mentioned in the job description, leaving the compensation details unclear. Confidence: 0.60 (minimal information provided)

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
The job description lacks explicit career progression details, offering only a general technical role description. Confidence: 0.50 (vague growth potential)

### mentorship_signals
No specific mentorship or collaborative learning opportunities are highlighted in the role. Confidence: 0.60 (limited mentorship information)

### promotion_path_mentioned
No clear advancement or promotion pathway is outlined in the job posting. Confidence: 0.90 (no promotion details)

### internal_mobility_mentioned
The description doesn't provide insights into potential internal career movement or role transitions. Confidence: 0.90 (no mobility information)

### career_tracks_available
The role appears to be a standard individual contributor position without explicit track differentiation. Confidence: 0.60 (limited career track details)

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
The job posting presents a balanced mix of mandatory and preferred qualifications, suggesting a moderate level of requirement strictness. Confidence: 0.75 (clear must-have vs nice-to-have distinction)

### scope_definition
The role maintains a focused approach on data engineering responsibilities, avoiding multi-role complexity. Confidence: 0.85 (clear, single-role focus)

### skill_inflation_detected
The skill requirements align reasonably with the senior-level position, avoiding unrealistic expectations. Confidence: 0.80 (appropriate skill set for seniority)
