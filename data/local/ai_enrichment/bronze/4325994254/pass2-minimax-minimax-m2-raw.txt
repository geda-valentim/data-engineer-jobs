<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics based on the Pass 1 extraction results and the original job posting.

Looking at the original job posting:
- Title: "Data Engineer-Data Platforms-Azure" at IBM
- Location: Kochi, Kerala, India
- Experience: "Total Exp-6-7 Yrs (Relevant-4-5 Yrs)"
- Work model: "onsite" (from Pass 1)
- Employment type: "full_time" (from Pass 1)

Let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Data Engineer" (no "Senior" in title)
- Experience: 6-7 years total, 4-5 years relevant
- Looking at the IC hierarchy: intern < entry < associate < junior < mid < senior < staff < principal < distinguished
- 6-7 years typically maps to "senior" level, but the title doesn't have "Senior" in it
- However, the responsibilities mention implementing predictive models, designing enterprise search applications, working in Agile environment - these suggest more senior responsibilities
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8 range - title doesn't match but experience and responsibilities suggest senior level
- I'll go with "senior" with confidence 0.75

### job_family
- Title clearly states "Data Engineer"
- Responsibilities focus on data gathering, storage, batch and real-time processing, database integration, ETL
- This is clearly a data engineer role
- Confidence: 0.95+ (very clear from title and responsibilities)

### sub_specialty
- Looking at the skills: Azure Databricks, Python/PySpark, SQL, Azure Devops, Azure Blob
- Mentions both "batch and real-time processing"
- ETL tools and data integration
- This suggests a hybrid approach but leans toward batch ETL with some streaming
- The Azure focus and Databricks suggest modern data engineering
- I'll go with "batch_etl" as primary specialty with confidence 0.75


- Leadership expectations point to a technical individual contributor role
- Responsibilities involve technical problem-solving without direct management
- Agile environment suggests collaboration but not supervisory duties
- Confidence level of 0.80 indicates a clear technical IC position

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
- Explicitly mentions "Azure" throughout
- Azure Databricks, Azure Devops, Azure Blob storage
- Very clear Azure focus
- Confidence: 0.95+

### secondary_clouds
- Only Azure mentioned, no other cloud providers
- Empty array with confidence 0.90

### processing_paradigm
- Mentions both "batch and real-time processing"
- This is clearly hybrid
- Confidence: 0.85+

### orchestrator_category
- No specific orchestrator mentioned
- Azure DevOps mentioned but that's CI/CD, not data orchestration
- No Airflow, Spark native, dbt, etc. mentioned
- "not_mentioned" with confidence 0.90

### storage_layer
- Azure Blob storage mentioned
- Databricks suggests data lake/lakehouse patterns
- No specific warehouse mentioned
- This leans toward "lake" or "lakehouse"
- I'll go with "lakehouse" since Databricks typically implies lakehouse architecture
- Confidence: 0.75

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
- Location: "Kochi, Kerala, India"
- Work model: "onsite"
- This suggests same country requirement (India)
- Confidence: 0.85

### timezone_focus
- Location in India suggests Asia-Pacific focus
- "specific_country" - India
- Confidence: 0.85

### relocation_required
- Already requires being in Kochi
- Onsite model
- This suggests relocation might be needed if not already in Kochi
- But the wording suggests they want someone already in Kochi
- I'll go with false - they want someone already in the location
- Confidence: 0.75

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
- This is an India-based role
- H1B is a US visa, not relevant for India
- "not_mentioned" in Pass 1
- For India roles, this wouldn't apply
- I'll go with false with confidence 0.90 (not applicable)

### opt_cpt_friendly
- Again, this is an India-based role
- OPT/CPT are US student visa programs
- Not applicable
- False with confidence 0.90

### citizenship_required
- India-based role
- No specific citizenship requirements mentioned
- "work_auth_only" would be appropriate
- But since it's India, work authorization would be for India
- I'll go with "work_auth_only" with confidence 0.75

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
- Employment type: "full_time"
- This suggests W2 employment
- No contract type mentioned
- "w2" with confidence 0.85

### benefits_level
- Pass 1 shows "benefits_mentioned": []
- No benefits discussed in the posting
- "none_mentioned" with confidence 0.90

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
- No specific career paths mentioned
- No promotion ladders discussed
- "not_mentioned" with confidence 0.90

### mentorship_signals
- Mentions "collaborative environment, partnering with other scientists, engineers, consultants"
- Working with diverse teams
- This suggests implied mentorship/learning environment
- "implied" with confidence 0.70

### promotion_path_mentioned
- No promotion or advancement mentioned
- False with confidence 0.90

### internal_mobility_mentioned
- No mention of internal transfers or role changes
- False with confidence 0.90

### career_tracks_available
- No career tracks mentioned
- Empty array with confidence 0.90

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
- Clear "Mandatory Skills" vs "Preferred Technical And Professional Experience"
- Mix of must-haves and nice-to-haves
- Medium level of strictness
- "medium" with confidence 0.75

### scope_definition
- Focused on data engineering role
- Clear responsibilities and requirements
- Not multi-role
- "clear" with confidence 0.85

### skill_inflation_detected
- 6-7 years experience for data engineer role
- Skills mentioned are appropriate for the experience level
- No obvious inflation
- False with confidence 0.80
