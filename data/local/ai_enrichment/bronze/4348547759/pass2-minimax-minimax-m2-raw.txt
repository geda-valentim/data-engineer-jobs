Now let me make inferences:

**SENIORITY AND ROLE:**
1. **seniority_level**: The job requires "Minimum 4+ years of experience in Big Data technologies" and "Minimum 3 years of experience on Cloud Data Platforms on Azure". This suggests a mid-to-senior level role. Given that it's 4+ years and involves complex technologies like Spark, Azure platforms, and streaming, this is likely a senior level role. 

I'll classify this as a senior position, reflecting the extensive experience requirements and complex technical responsibilities. The role demands deep expertise in big data technologies and cloud platforms, indicating a high level of technical proficiency.

2. **job_family**: The title is "Data Engineer" and the responsibilities are clearly focused on data pipeline development, data processing, and big data technologies. This is clearly a data engineer role.

3. **sub_specialty**: The job mentions "Experience in developing streaming pipelines" and "Kafka technologies" along with batch processing. This suggests a hybrid approach, but with significant streaming component. The mention of "streaming pipelines" and "Kafka" indicates streaming_realtime as the primary focus.

4. **leadership_expectation**: The job description doesn't mention any leadership responsibilities, mentoring, or direct reports. It's focused on technical execution and development. This suggests a pure IC role.

**STACK AND CLOUD:**
1. **primary_cloud**: The job explicitly mentions "Azure Cloud Data Platform" and lists multiple Azure services: "DataBricks / Azure HDInsight / Azure Data Factory, Synapse, SQL Server DB". This is clearly an Azure-focused role.

2. **secondary_clouds**: The job mentions "HDFS" which is typically associated with on-premise Hadoop clusters, but the primary focus is clearly Azure. No other cloud providers are mentioned.

3. **processing_paradigm**: The job mentions both "streaming pipelines" and batch processing with Spark. It specifically calls out "Experience in developing streaming pipelines" and "Kafka technologies", indicating both streaming and batch capabilities.

4. **orchestrator_category**: The job doesn't mention any specific orchestration tools like Airflow, Databricks workflows, etc. The focus is on the development and processing frameworks rather than orchestration.

5. **storage_layer**: The job mentions "HDFS" (Hadoop Distributed File System) which is typically associated with data lakes, and also mentions "SQL Server DB" which could be data warehouse. It also mentions "Azure Cloud Data Platform" which could include both lake and warehouse components. This suggests a mixed approach.

**GEO AND WORK MODEL:**
1. **remote_restriction**: The job is located in "Pune, Maharashtra, India" but doesn't specify any remote work restrictions or requirements. No mention of remote work model.

2. **timezone_focus**: The job is based in India (Pune) but doesn't mention any specific timezone requirements or team distribution.

3. **relocation_required**: The job is already located in Pune, India, so no relocation would be required for local candidates.

**VISA AND AUTHORIZATION:**
1. **h1b_friendly**: The job is in India and doesn't mention any visa sponsorship. Since it's a local India position, H1B (which is a US visa) wouldn't be relevant.

2. **opt_cpt_friendly**: Again, this is an India-based position, so US student visa programs like OPT/CPT wouldn't be applicable.

3. **citizenship_required**: No citizenship or work authorization requirements are mentioned for this India-based position.

**CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION:**
1. **w2_vs_1099**: No contract type is specified. This appears to be a standard employment position at IBM.

2. **benefits_level**: No benefits are mentioned in the job description.

**CAREER DEVELOPMENT:**
1. **growth_path_clarity**: No career growth or advancement paths are mentioned.

2. **mentorship_signals**: No mentorship programs or working with senior people are mentioned.

3. **promotion_path_mentioned**: No promotion or advancement opportunities are mentioned.

4. **internal_mobility_mentioned**: No internal mobility or role change opportunities are mentioned.

5. **career_tracks_available**: No career tracks are mentioned.

**REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION:**
1. **requirement_strictness**: The job has clear "Minimum" requirements and "Good to excellent SQL skills" which suggests medium to high strictness.

2. **scope_definition**: The job is clearly focused on data engineering with specific technologies and responsibilities. This is a clear scope.

3. **skill_inflation_detected**: The requirements seem reasonable for a senior data engineer role with 4+ years experience. The skills mentioned are appropriate for the level.
