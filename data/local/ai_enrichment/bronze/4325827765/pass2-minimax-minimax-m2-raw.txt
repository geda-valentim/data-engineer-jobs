<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics based on the Pass 1 extraction results and the original job posting.

Looking at the original job posting:
- Title: "Data Consultant-Data Governance" at IBM
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- The role involves data engineering, data governance, working with Alation and Manta platforms
- Mentions both batch and real-time processing
- Requires Master's degree
- Work model is onsite in Pune
- No salary information disclosed
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No benefits mentioned

Let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
The title is "Data Consultant-Data Governance" which suggests a consultant role, but the responsibilities mention implementing predictive models, designing enterprise search applications, working with big data, machine learning, etc. This suggests mid to senior level. The Master's degree requirement also suggests this isn't entry level. However, no specific years of experience are mentioned. Given the complexity of the work (data governance, predictive models, enterprise applications), this seems like a mid to senior level role. I'll go with "senior" as the responsibilities are quite advanced.

### job_family
The title mentions "Data Consultant" but the core responsibilities are clearly data engineering focused - data gathering, storage, batch and real-time processing, database integration, data cleansing, etc. The Pass 1 extraction also shows many data engineering skills. This is clearly a data engineer role.

### sub_specialty
The role is heavily focused on data governance, data lineage, metadata analysis, data quality, and compliance. The mention of Alation and Manta platforms specifically for data governance suggests this is a data governance specialty within data engineering.

### leadership_expectation
The role mentions working in teams, collaborating with cross-functional teams, but doesn't mention managing people or direct reports. It seems like an IC role with some technical collaboration but no people management responsibilities.

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
No specific cloud providers are mentioned in the job posting. 

The absence of cloud-specific technologies indicates an on-premise or cloud-agnostic approach. The role's focus on data governance and enterprise applications suggests a technology-neutral perspective, prioritizing data management over specific cloud infrastructure.

### secondary_clouds
Since no clouds are mentioned, this will be an empty array.

### processing_paradigm
The job posting explicitly mentions both "batch and real-time processing", which clearly indicates a hybrid approach to data processing.

### orchestrator_category
No specific orchestration tools are mentioned in the job posting.

### storage_layer
No specific storage systems are mentioned - no data warehouses, lakes, or lakehouse technologies are referenced.

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
The job posting clearly states "Pune, Maharashtra, India" as the location and mentions "onsite" work model. This suggests a same_country restriction to India.

### timezone_focus
Given the location is Pune, India, this would be India timezone (IST), but no specific timezone requirements are mentioned.

### relocation_required
The role is specifically for Pune, Maharashtra, India, and requires onsite work. This suggests relocation to Pune would be required for non-residents.

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
The job is in India, so H1B (US visa) is not relevant. The Pass 1 extraction shows "not_mentioned" for visa sponsorship.

### opt_cpt_friendly
Again, this is an India-based role, so US student visas (OPT/CPT) are not relevant. 

### citizenship_required
Since this is an India-based role, it would require Indian work authorization, but no specific citizenship requirements are mentioned.

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
No contract type is mentioned in the Pass 1 extraction. This appears to be a full-time employee position at IBM, but contract specifics aren't provided.

### benefits_level
The Pass 1 extraction shows no benefits mentioned, so this would be "none_mentioned".

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
No career growth or advancement paths are mentioned in the job posting.

### mentorship_signals
No mentorship programs or working with senior people are specifically mentioned.

### promotion_path_mentioned
No promotion or advancement opportunities are mentioned.

### internal_mobility_mentioned
No internal mobility or role transfer opportunities are mentioned.

### career_tracks_available
No specific career tracks are mentioned.

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
The job posting has a clear list of "Required Technical And Professional Expertise" and "Preferred Technical And Professional Experience", suggesting medium strictness with clear must-haves vs nice-to-haves.

### scope_definition
The role is clearly focused on data governance consulting within data engineering - it's not a multi-role hybrid position.

### skill_inflation_detected
The skills mentioned (data governance, Alation, Manta, predictive models, etc.) seem reasonable for a senior data engineering role focused on governance. No obvious skill inflation detected.

Let me now create the JSON response with appropriate confidence levels and evidence.
