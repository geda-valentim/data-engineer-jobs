<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me go through each section systematically.

First, let me identify what information is explicitly stated in the job posting:

**Title**: Data Engineer-Data Integration
**Company**: IBM
**Location**: Pune, Maharashtra, India

Now let me go through each field in the JSON structure:

1. **compensation**: No salary information is mentioned in the job posting, so all compensation fields should be null/false.

2. **work_authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. No security clearance mentioned either.

3. **work_model**: The location is "Pune, Maharashtra, India" which suggests onsite work, but there's no explicit mention of work model (remote/hybrid/onsite). Employment type is not explicitly mentioned as full-time, but given it's a standard engineering role at IBM, I should be conservative and use "not_mentioned" unless explicitly stated.

4. **contract_details**: No contract information is mentioned, so this should be "not_mentioned" for contract_type and null for other fields.

5. **contractor_rates**: No contractor information, so "not_mentioned" for pay_type and null for rates.

6. **skills_classified**: This is where I need to carefully analyze the text for hard and soft skills.

Let me analyze the skills mentioned:

**Hard Skills mentioned:**
- Data warehousing/ information Management/ Data Integration/Business Intelligence using ETL tool Informatica PowerCenter (this appears to be required expertise)
- Cloud, Power BI, Data migration on cloud skills
- Unix shell scripting and python
- relational SQL, Big Data
- MS-Azure Cloud
- Informatica PowerCenter (mentioned twice)
- Unix shell scripting and python (mentioned twice)

**Soft Skills mentioned:**
- "Work in an Agile, collaborative environment, partnering with other scientists, engineers, consultants and database administrators of all backgrounds and disciplines" - this suggests collaboration skills
- "collaborating closely with diverse teams" - collaboration
- "Liaise with business team and technical leads" - communication/collaboration
