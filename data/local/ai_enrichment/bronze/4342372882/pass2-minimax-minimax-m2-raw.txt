<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting Analysis:**
- Title: Data Engineer
- Company: Wassching
- Location: Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands
- This is a Process Intelligence role focused on data engineering for process mining
- 3-5+ years experience required
- Must have: SQL, ETL/ELT, data modeling, Databricks, Snowflake, ERP systems, SAP, Python, process mining platforms
- Nice to have: PQL, Kafka, streaming technologies, ITSM systems, ServiceNow, legacy environments, APIs, event-driven connections
- Hybrid/remote flexibility mentioned
- Full-time permanent position
- Bachelor's degree required
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- Benefits: competitive compensation, development opportunities, ownership, modern workplace, hybrid/remote flexibility

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- ext_work_model_stated: "hybrid"
- ext_employment_type_stated: "full_time"
- ext_contract_type: "permanent"
- ext_visa_sponsorship_stated: "not_mentioned"
- ext_years_experience_min: 3.0
- ext_years_experience_max: null
- ext_years_experience_text: "3–5+ years"
- ext_education_level: "BACHELORS"
- ext_benefits_mentioned: ["Competitive compensation", "development opportunities", "ownership from day one", "modern workplace", "hybrid/remote flexibility", "office dog"]

Now let me make inferences according to the rules:

**SENIORITY INFERENCE:**
- Title: "Data Engineer" (no "Senior" in title)
- Experience: 3-5+ years
- This suggests mid-level to senior level
- Given 3-5+ years and the complexity of requirements (SAP, process mining, multiple platforms), this seems like a senior role
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8 (title doesn't say "Senior" but experience and complexity suggest senior)


- Job family clearly points to data engineering as the primary role
- Sub-specialty centers on process mining and data transformation
- Leadership expectations lean towards technical individual contributor role

**STACK AND CLOUD ANALYSIS:**
- Cloud infrastructure remains ambiguous
- Processing approach appears hybrid, combining batch and streaming technologies
- Orchestration strategy not explicitly defined
- Storage solution suggests a mixed approach with warehouse and lakehouse elements

**GEOGRAPHIC AND WORK MODEL INSIGHTS:**
- Remote work flexibility suggests global talent accessibility
- Timezone considerations appear open-ended
- No immediate relocation constraints identified

**VISA AND AUTHORIZATION CONSIDERATIONS:**
- Visa sponsorship status remains unclear
- Work authorization requirements need further clarification
- Citizenship requirements not explicitly defined

**CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION STRUCTURE:**
- Employment type indicates full-time commitment
- Benefits package appears comprehensive, including competitive compensation and development opportunities
- Equity participation suggests potential long-term engagement

**CAREER DEVELOPMENT TRAJECTORY:**
- Growth opportunities implied but not precisely mapped
- Mentorship potential exists through collaborative team environment
- Promotion pathways not explicitly outlined
- Internal mobility options remain undefined
- Career progression tracks appear flexible, potentially including individual contributor and specialist paths

**REQUIREMENTS ASSESSMENT:**
- Requirements demonstrate balanced approach with clear must-haves and preferred qualifications
- Role scope maintains focused data engineering perspective
- Skill expectations align appropriately with seniority level
- No significant skill inflation detected in current role description
