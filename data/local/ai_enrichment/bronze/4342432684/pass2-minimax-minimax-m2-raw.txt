<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting carefully to infer the job characteristics based on the Pass 1 extraction results and the original job posting.

Looking at the job posting:
- Title: Data Modeler_W2_ Sacramento CA
- Company: Chelsoft Solutions Co.
- Location: Sacramento, CA
- Work model: Hybrid (2 days in office - Monday and Wednesday)
- Must live within 60 miles from location

Let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
The job requires "Minimum of ten (10) years demonstrable experience in the data management space with at least 5 years specializing in database design" and "Minimum of five (5) years of experience as a data analyst or in other quantitative analysis". This is clearly a senior-level position requiring 10+ years of experience. The title doesn't have "Senior" in it, but the experience requirements are definitely senior level. Confidence: 0.85

### job_family
This is clearly a data modeling role focused on enterprise data warehouse, dimensional modeling, and database design. This falls under "data_engineer" as the primary job family, though it's more specialized toward data modeling. Confidence: 0.90

### sub_specialty
The role focuses heavily on data warehouse implementation, dimensional modeling (Kimball framework), and enterprise data management. This is primarily "data_warehouse" focused. Confidence: 0.85

### leadership_expectation
The role mentions "Mentors and educates team members on best practices" and "Ability to perform technical leadership of a Oracle data warehouse team including but not limited to ETL, requirements solicitation, DBA, data warehouse administration, and data analysis on a hands-on basis." This suggests technical leadership without direct reports - "tech_lead_ic". Confidence: 0.80

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
The job specifically mentions "Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) specifically installed in an OCI environment" and "OCI environment" multiple times. This is clearly Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Confidence: 0.95


I'll continue analyzing the secondary cloud providers and processing paradigms. The job posting reveals a strong focus on Oracle's cloud ecosystem, with no additional cloud providers mentioned. The processing approach appears to be primarily batch-oriented, centered around data warehouse implementations and ETL activities using Oracle's native tools. The dimensional modeling and enterprise data warehouse focus suggest a structured, scheduled data processing approach rather than real-time streaming.

The storage layer is clearly warehouse-centric, with explicit references to Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and dimensional modeling techniques like Star, Snowflake, and Hybrid schemas. This indicates a traditional, structured data storage strategy aligned with enterprise data warehouse best practices.

The geographic constraints are precise: candidates must be within 60 miles of Sacramento, California, with a hybrid work model requiring two days weekly in-office presence. The timezone focus is specific to the Pacific Time Zone, given the Sacramento location.

Relocation requirements are nuanced - while not explicitly mandating relocation, the 60-mile proximity requirement essentially necessitates local residence. The role appears to target candidates already established in the Sacramento metropolitan area.

Visa and work authorization details remain unspecified, with no explicit sponsorship or citizenship restrictions mentioned. The employment structure suggests a standard full-time W2 arrangement, though benefits are not comprehensively detailed.

Career development signals are limited, with minimal guidance on growth trajectories or mentorship opportunities. The role seems focused on immediate technical execution rather than long-term professional advancement.

Requirements appear moderately structured, balancing mandatory qualifications with some flexibility. The scope is clearly defined around data modeling, avoiding multi-role complexity. Skill expectations align appropriately with senior-level responsibilities, maintaining realistic expectations for candidates.

The inference process reveals a nuanced approach to role characterization, carefully extracting meaningful insights from limited textual information.
