<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting step by step to infer the job characteristics.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting:**
- Title: Data Engineer-Data Modeling
- Company: IBM
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- 12+ years experience required
- Master's degree preferred
- Focus on data modeling, data architecture, Erwin, IBM Infosphere Data Architect
- Database design, data warehousing, data governance
- SQL programming
- Agile collaborative environment

**Pass 1 Extraction:**
- No salary disclosed
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No work model stated
- No employment type stated
- 12+ years experience required
- Master's degree preferred
- Must-have skills: Data modeling, data architecture, Erwin, IBM Infosphere Data Architect, database management systems, relational/dimensional/NoSQL databases, database design, data warehousing, data governance, SQL
- Must-have soft skills: Analytical skills, problem solving, attention to detail, team collaboration, time management
- No benefits mentioned
- No certifications mentioned

Now let me infer each field:

**SENIORITY AND ROLE:**
1. **seniority_level**: The job requires 12+ years of experience and has "Data Engineer" in the title. This suggests a senior level role. Looking at the IC hierarchy, 12+ years would typically be at senior level or above. Given the title doesn't include "Senior" but requires 12+ years, this is likely a senior role. Confidence: 0.8

2. **job_family**: The title is "Data Engineer-Data Modeling" and the core responsibilities are around data modeling, data architecture, database design, and data warehousing. This is clearly a data engineer role. Confidence: 0.95

3. **sub_specialty**: The role focuses heavily on data modeling, data architecture, database design, and data warehousing concepts. This suggests a focus on data modeling/architecture rather than streaming, ML ops, etc. This would be "general" or possibly "data_modeling" but since that's not in the allowed values, I'll use "general". 

I'll explore the leadership expectations for this role. The position requires extensive experience and involves complex data architecture work. While not explicitly stating management duties, the 12+ years of experience and collaborative environment suggest potential technical leadership responsibilities. The role likely involves guiding less experienced team members and contributing to strategic data infrastructure decisions.

The cloud infrastructure remains ambiguous, with no specific provider mentioned. The job description focuses on data modeling tools like Erwin and IBM Infosphere Data Architect, which are platform-agnostic. This suggests flexibility in cloud technology choices, with the role potentially adapting to different enterprise environments.

The processing approach seems to center on traditional data warehousing and modeling techniques. While not explicitly stating batch or streaming, the emphasis on data architecture and modeling implies a structured, potentially batch-oriented data processing methodology.

The absence of specific orchestration tools means I'll need to mark this as "not_mentioned" for now. The storage layer appears to be a hybrid approach, combining traditional data warehousing concepts with modern data lakehouse principles.

Geographically, the role is based in Pune, India, with no explicit remote work options mentioned. This suggests a localized, on-site work arrangement with potential regional constraints.

The visa and authorization details remain unclear, with no specific sponsorship or work authorization requirements explicitly stated. The employment type seems to lean towards a standard full-time position, though no definitive contract type is specified.

Benefits appear minimal, with no comprehensive package details provided. The role seems to offer a basic employment structure without extensive additional perks.

Career development opportunities seem limited, with no clear growth path or mentorship programs explicitly outlined. The requirements suggest a high level of technical expertise, with a focus on data modeling and architecture skills.

The role demands significant experience, indicating a senior-level position with complex technical responsibilities. The scope appears well-defined, centered on data engineering and modeling, without unnecessary role inflation.
