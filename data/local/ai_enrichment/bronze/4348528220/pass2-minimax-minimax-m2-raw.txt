<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting:**
- Title: Data Engineer-Data Integration
- Company: IBM
- Location: Hyderabad, Telangana, India
- Role involves data gathering, storage, batch and real-time processing
- Key technologies: Snowflake, Talend, Elasticsearch, Splunk
- Focus on data warehouse solutions, data ingestion/transformation pipelines
- Cloud platform integration
- Dimensional and relational data modeling

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- Work model: onsite
- Location restriction: Hyderabad, Telangana, India
- Must-have skills: Snowflake, Talend, data warehouse solutions, data pipelines, cloud integration, SQL, Shell scripting
- Nice-to-have skills: Snowflake optimization, data validation/cleansing/governance frameworks
- No salary, benefits, or visa information mentioned
- No years of experience specified
- No education requirements mentioned

Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
The title is "Data Engineer-Data Integration" without any seniority indicator like "Senior", "Junior", etc. The responsibilities mention implementing predictive models, designing enterprise search applications, and working with complex data sets, which suggests mid to senior level. However, no years of experience are specified. The skills required are quite advanced (Snowflake, Talend, cloud integration, data modeling) which suggests this isn't an entry-level role. Given the lack of explicit seniority in title and no experience requirements, this is likely a mid-level position.

**Value: "mid"**
**Confidence: 0.6** (moderate inference from responsibilities and skills)
**Evidence: "Data Engineer title without seniority indicator, but advanced technical requirements suggest mid-level rather than entry-level"**
**Source: "inferred"**

### job_family
The title is clearly "Data Engineer" and the core responsibilities are around data gathering, storage, processing pipelines, data warehouse solutions, and data integration. This is clearly a data engineering role.


**Value: "data_engineer"**
**Confidence: 0.95** (very clear from title and responsibilities)
**Evidence: "Title is Data Engineer with core focus on data pipelines, warehousing, and integration"**
**Source: "pass1_derived"**

### sub_specialty
The role involves both batch and real-time processing, with mentions of data ingestion, transformation pipelines, and enterprise search applications. The focus seems to be on data integration and ETL pipelines rather than specific areas like ML infrastructure or data governance.

**Value: "batch_etl"**
**Confidence: 0.75** (strong focus on data pipelines and transformation)
**Evidence: "Emphasis on data ingestion, transformation pipelines, and batch processing alongside real-time"**
**Source: "inferred"**

### leadership_expectation
The role description doesn't mention any leadership responsibilities, mentoring, or direct reports. It's focused on technical implementation and collaboration with teams.

**Value: "ic"**
**Confidence: 0.85** (no leadership signals mentioned)
**Evidence: "No mention of leadership, mentoring, or direct reports - pure IC role"**
