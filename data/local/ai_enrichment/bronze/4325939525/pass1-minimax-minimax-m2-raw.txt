<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me analyze the job posting text:

Title: Sr. Data Engineer(hands on Palantir exp.)
Company: Pacer Group
Location: Atlanta, GA

Description:
Position: Sr. Data Engineer(hands on Palantir exp.) Location: Atlanta, GA Looking for locals only for onsite and independent candidate Technical Expertise • 8 - 10 years of strong Data Engineering experience •Hands-on experience in Palantir Foundry to design and implement scalable data solutions. •Experience with Hadoop-based technologies including, but not limited to: Hive, PySpark, etc. Show more Show less

Let me go through each section systematically:

1. **compensation**: No salary information is mentioned, so all compensation fields should be null/false.

2. **work_authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization, or citizenship requirements. No security clearance mentioned. So:
   - visa_sponsorship_stated: "not_mentioned"
   - work_auth_text: null
   - citizenship_text: null
   - security_clearance_stated: "not_mentioned"

3. **work_model**: 
   - Location is Atlanta, GA
   - Says "Looking for locals only for onsite" - this indicates onsite work model
   - employment_type: Not explicitly mentioned, but this appears to be a full-time position based on context
   - work_model_stated: "onsite"
   - location_restriction_text: "Looking for locals only for onsite"
   - employment_type_stated: "full_time"

4. **contract_details**: No mention of contract type, duration, etc. This appears to be a permanent position.
   - contract_type: "permanent" (inferred from full-time position)
   - All other contract fields: null

5. **contractor_rates**: Not applicable as this appears to be a permanent employee position.
   - pay_type: "not_mentioned"
   - All other contractor rate fields: null

6. **skills_classified**:
   - must_have_hard_skills: Based on the description, I need to identify skills with strong qualifiers:
     - "8 - 10 years of strong Data Engineering experience" - "strong" is a strong qualifier
     - "Hands-on experience in Palantir Foundry" - "hands-on" is a strong qualifier
     - "Experience with Hadoop-based technologies" - this is mentioned without strong qualifier, but it's in the technical expertise section
     - "Hive, PySpark" - these are specific technologies mentioned
   - nice_to_have_hard_skills: None explicitly mentioned with weak qualifiers
   - must_have_soft_skills: None explicitly mentioned
   - nice_to_have_soft_skills: None explicitly mentioned
   - certifications_mentioned: None mentioned
   - years_experience_min: 8, years_experience_max: 10, years_experience_text: "8 - 10 years"
   - education_level: Not mentioned
   - education_area: Not mentioned
   - education_requirement: "not_mentioned"
   - education_text_raw: null
   - llm_genai_mentioned: false (no mention of LLMs, GenAI, etc.)
   - feature_store_mentioned: false (no mention of feature stores)

7. **geographic_restrictions**:
   - geo_restriction_type: "us_only" (based on "locals only" and Atlanta, GA location)
   - allowed_countries: ["US"]
   - excluded_countries: null
   - us_state_restrictions: null
   - residency_requirement: "must_be_resident" (based on "locals only")

8. **benefits_structured**: No benefits mentioned
   - benefits_mentioned: []
   - equity_mentioned: false
   - learning_budget_mentioned: false
   - conference_budget_mentioned: false
   - hardware_choice_mentioned: false
   - pto_policy: "not_mentioned"

9. **context**:
   - team_info_text: null
   - company_description_text: null

Let me count the fields and check completeness:
- Total fields in the schema: Let me count... compensation (10), work_authorization (4), work_model (3), contract_details (7), contractor_rates (6), skills_classified (15), geographic_restrictions (5), benefits_structured (6), context (2) = 58 fields
- Fields with actual data: Let me count... compensation (0), work_authorization (1), work_model (3), contract_details (1), contractor_rates (1), skills_classified (4), geographic_restrictions (2), benefits_structured (0), context (0) = 12 fields
- Fields that are null: 58 - 12 = 46 fields

Wait, let me double-check the skills classification. Looking at the job posting again:

"Technical Expertise • 8 - 10 years of strong Data Engineering experience •Hands-on experience in Palantir Foundry to design and implement scalable data solutions. •Experience with Hadoop-based technologies including, but not limited to: Hive, PySpark, etc."

For skills classification:
- "8 - 10 years of strong Data Engineering experience" - "strong" is a strong qualifier, so "Data Engineering" should be in must_have_hard_skills
- "Hands-on experience in Palantir Foundry" - "hands-on" is a strong qualifier, so "Palantir Foundry" should be in must_have_hard_skills
- "Experience with Hadoop-based technologies" - this is in the technical expertise section but doesn't have a strong qualifier. However, it's listed as part of the core technical requirements, so I should include it.
- "Hive, PySpark" - these are specific technologies mentioned, should be in must_have_hard_skills

Actually, let me reconsider the Hadoop-based technologies. The text says "Experience with Hadoop-based technologies including, but not limited to: Hive, PySpark, etc." This seems to be part of the core technical requirements, so these should be in must_have_hard_skills.

Let me also check if there are any soft skills mentioned. Looking at the text again, I don't see any explicit soft skills mentioned like communication, leadership, etc.

For the geographic restrictions, the text says "Looking for locals only for onsite" which clearly indicates they want local candidates only, so this is a US-only restriction with residency requirement.
