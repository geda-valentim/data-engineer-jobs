Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Associate Software Developer" but also mentions "Data Engineer"
- Experience: 6-7 years total (4-5 relevant)
- This suggests mid-to-senior level
- Associate title with 6-7 years is a bit unusual - typically associate would be 2-4 years
- But the experience level and responsibilities suggest senior level
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8 range

### job_family
- Title clearly states "Data Engineer"
- Responsibilities focus on data pipelines, ETL, data processing
- This is clearly a data engineer role
- Confidence: 0.9+

### sub_specialty
- Azure Databricks mentioned as mandatory
- Python/PySpark mentioned
- ETL tools mentioned


- Batch and real-time processing capabilities
- Indicates a hybrid data processing approach
- Suggests expertise in both traditional and modern data engineering techniques
- Confidence: 0.8

### leadership_expectation
- Role involves collaborating with diverse teams
- No explicit mention of direct reports or management responsibilities
- Focus appears to be on technical execution rather than people management
- Indicates an individual contributor position
- Confidence: 0.8

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
- Azure Databricks explicitly mentioned as mandatory
- Azure Devops mentioned
- Azure Blob mentioned
- Clear Azure focus
- Confidence: 0.9+

### secondary_clouds
- No other cloud providers mentioned
- Only Azure services listed
- Confidence: 0.9+

### processing_paradigm
- Mentions both "batch and real-time processing"
- This indicates a hybrid approach
- Confidence: 0.8+

### orchestrator_category
- No specific orchestrator mentioned
- Azure DevOps mentioned but that's CI/CD, not data orchestration
- No Airflow, Spark native, dbt, etc. mentioned
- Confidence: <0.5, so "not_mentioned"

### storage_layer
- Azure Blob mentioned (data lake)
- Databricks (can work with both lake and warehouse)
- No specific warehouse mentioned like Snowflake, Redshift
- Suggests lake or lakehouse approach
- Confidence: 0.7

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
- Location: Kochi, Kerala, India
- Work model: On-site
- Specific location required
- This suggests "same_region" or "same_country"
- Since it's a specific city in India, "same_region" fits best
- Confidence: 0.8

### timezone_focus
- Location is Kochi, India
- This would be IST (Indian Standard Time)
- Part of APAC region
- Confidence: 0.9+

### relocation_required
- On-site role in specific location
- No mention of relocation package
- Implies you need to already be in Kochi or willing to move there
- Confidence: 0.8

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- This is an India-based role
- H1B is US-specific, so not applicable
- But based on "not_mentioned" in Pass 1, this would be false
- Confidence: 0.9+

### opt_cpt_friendly
- No mention of student visas
- Work authorization required but no specific mention of OPT/CPT
- Since this is India-based, US student visas don't apply
- Confidence: 0.8+

### citizenship_required
- No citizenship requirements mentioned
- Work authorization mentioned but no specific restrictions
- This would be "work_auth_only" or "any"
- Since it's India-based, likely "any" or "work_auth_only"
- Confidence: 0.7

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
- Full-time employment type
- This suggests W2 employment
- No contractor language mentioned
- Confidence: 0.8+

### benefits_level

- This would be "none_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.9+

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
- No specific career paths mentioned

- This would be "not_mentioned"
- Confidence: 0.9+

### mentorship_signals

- Clear responsibilities and requirements
- Not a multi-role hybrid position
- This suggests "clear"
- Confidence: 0.8

### skill_inflation_detected

Let me now compile this into the required JSON format.
