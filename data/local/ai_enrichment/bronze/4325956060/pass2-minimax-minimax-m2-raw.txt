<reasoning>Let me analyze the job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to make inferences about the job characteristics.

First, let me review the key information:

**Original Job Posting:**
- Title: Data Engineer-Data Platforms
- Company: IBM
- Location: Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India
- Work model: Onsite (from Pass 1)
- Employment type: Full-time (from Pass 1)
- No salary information disclosed
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No benefits mentioned

**Key technical requirements:**
- Apache Spark (PySpark) - must have
- Big Data Technologies: Hadoop, HDFS, Kafka - nice to have
- ETL pipelines, data modeling, data warehousing - must have
- Python, Pandas, NumPy - must have
- SQL - must have
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP - must have

**Responsibilities:**
- Lead design and construction of solutions
- Provide support/guidance to project teams
- Complex coding, issue resolution
- Continuous improvements
- Agile framework

Now let me make inferences for each category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

**seniority_level**: The role mentions "Lead the design and construction" and "provide regular support/guidance to project teams" which suggests senior-level responsibilities. However, no specific years of experience are mentioned. The title is "Data Engineer" without "Senior" in it, but the responsibilities suggest senior-level work. I'll go with "senior" with moderate confidence.

**job_family**: This is clearly a "data_engineer" role based on the title and focus on ETL pipelines, data modeling, and data warehousing.

**sub_specialty**: The role mentions both batch processing (ETL pipelines, data warehousing) and mentions Kafka which is for streaming. This suggests a "hybrid" processing paradigm, so I'll classify as "batch_etl" as the primary focus with streaming capabilities.

**leadership_expectation**: The role mentions "Lead the design and construction" and "provide regular support/guidance to project teams" which suggests technical leadership without direct reports. This fits "tech_lead_ic".
 
I'll analyze the cloud infrastructure and geographic constraints. The role requires expertise across multiple cloud platforms - AWS, Azure, and GCP - indicating a "multi" cloud approach. The work model is strictly onsite in Bengaluru, with no remote work flexibility. This suggests a localized, in-person team structure with potential for cross-cloud technical leadership.

The visa and authorization details reveal a standard employment approach. No specific visa sponsorship is mentioned, and the role requires standard work authorization. The employment type is full-time, likely using a W2 contract structure. Benefits are not specified, which is common in initial job postings.

Career development appears limited, with no explicit growth path or mentorship signals mentioned. The requirements seem moderately structured, focusing on core technical competencies without excessive complexity.

The role targets a senior data engineer with strong technical leadership capabilities, emphasizing hands-on design, construction, and team guidance across multiple cloud platforms.
