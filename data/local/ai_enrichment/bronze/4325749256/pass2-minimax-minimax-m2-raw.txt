<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting Analysis:**
- Title: "Data Engineer-Data Platforms-Azure" at IBM
- Location: Kochi, Kerala, India (onsite)
- Experience: 6-7 years total, 4-5 years relevant
- Skills: Azure Databricks, Python/PySpark, SQL, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Azure Blob, Java, Scala, ETL, data integration, Linux, Spark, Hadoop
- Role involves: data gathering, storage, batch and real-time processing, database integration, unstructured data, predictive models, statistical models, enterprise search applications (Elasticsearch, Splunk)

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- Work model: onsite
- Location: Kochi, Kerala, India
- Employment type: full_time
- Contract type: permanent
- Must-have skills: Azure Databricks, Python, PySpark, SQL, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Azure Blob, Java, Scala, ETL, data integration, Linux, Spark, Hadoop
- Years experience: 6-7 years total, 4-5 years relevant
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No benefits mentioned
- No security clearance mentioned

Now let me infer each field:

**1. SENIORITY AND ROLE:**

**seniority_level:**
- Title: "Data Engineer" (no "Senior" in title)
- Experience: 6-7 years total, 4-5 years relevant
- Responsibilities: Implementing predictive models, designing enterprise search applications, working in Agile environment
- This seems like a mid-to-senior level role given 6-7 years experience and responsibilities like implementing models and designing applications
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8 (strong inference from experience + responsibilities)
- Value: "mid" (6-7 years is typically mid-level for data engineering)


- Source: "inferred"

I'll continue analyzing the job family and sub-specialty. The role clearly falls into data engineering, with a strong focus on Azure platforms. The responsibilities span multiple data processing domains, including batch and real-time processing, ETL, and data integration. The Azure-centric nature suggests a cloud-focused data engineering approach, with expertise in Azure-specific tools like Databricks and DevOps.

The leadership expectation appears to be an individual contributor role, with no explicit management responsibilities mentioned. The role involves technical implementation and collaboration, but no direct team leadership or management duties are indicated.

Cloud infrastructure is definitively Azure-based, with multiple Azure services explicitly required. The processing paradigm is hybrid, covering both batch and real-time data processing. While no specific orchestrator is mentioned, the Azure DevOps requirement suggests potential cloud-native workflow management.

Storage layer remains unclear, with no explicit data warehouse or lake references in the current information.

Geographically, the role is restricted to India, specifically Kochi, Kerala, with no remote work options. The timezone focus is India, and no relocation is required since the position is already location-specific.

Visa and work authorization details are limited, with no explicit sponsorship mentioned. The employment type suggests a standard W2 full-time position, though specific contract details are not fully defined.

Benefits are not specified, leaving the compensation and additional perks uncertain. The role appears to be a standard full-time employment arrangement without additional details about potential supplementary benefits.

Career development opportunities seem limited, with no clear growth path, mentorship programs, or internal mobility mentioned. The role appears to be a straightforward technical position without explicit advancement mechanisms.

Requirements are moderately defined, with a clear technical skill set and specific experience expectations. The scope is focused on data engineering, with a reasonable skill combination that doesn't appear inflated or unrealistic.
