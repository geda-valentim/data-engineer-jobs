<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting step by step to infer the required characteristics.

First, let me understand what I have:

1. **Original Job Posting**: Data Engineer-Data Platforms at IBM in Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India
2. **Pass 1 Extraction**: Contains various extracted fields like work model (onsite), location restriction, skills, etc.

Now I need to infer the characteristics based on the rules provided. Let me go through each section:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
Looking at the job title "Data Engineer-Data Platforms" - this doesn't have "Senior" in the title. The responsibilities mention "Lead the design and construction" which suggests some leadership but not necessarily senior level. No specific years of experience mentioned. The skills required are quite comprehensive (Spark, PySpark, ETL, Python, SQL, cloud platforms) which could suggest mid to senior level, but without explicit years or "Senior" in title, I should be conservative.

**Inference**: "mid" - confidence around 0.6-0.7. The comprehensive skill set suggests more than entry level, but lack of "Senior" in title and no explicit years suggests not senior level.

### job_family
Title is "Data Engineer" and the description focuses on "development, design of application", "ETL pipelines, data modeling, and data warehousing concepts", "distributed data processing". This is clearly a data engineering role.

**Inference**: "data_engineer" - confidence 0.95

### sub_specialty
The role mentions "Apache Spark (PySpark)", "Big Data Technologies: Hadoop, HDFS, Kafka", "ETL pipelines", "data warehousing". This suggests batch ETL and data warehousing focus, with some big data streaming capabilities (Kafka mentioned).

**Inference**: "batch_etl" - confidence 0.8

### leadership_expectation
The description mentions "provide regular support/guidance to project teams on complex coding, issue resolution and execution" and "Lead the design and construction of new solutions". This suggests technical leadership without direct reports mentioned.
 
I'll focus on the technical leadership aspects, noting the role involves guiding teams without direct management responsibilities. The position emphasizes technical expertise and solution design, pointing to a tech lead individual contributor path.

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
The job posting mentions "Cloud Platforms: Experience working with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP". This lists multiple clouds without a clear primary, suggesting a multi-cloud approach.

**Inference**: "multi" - confidence 0.8

### secondary_clouds
Since primary is "multi", secondary_clouds would be empty array.

**Inference**: [] - confidence 0.9

### processing_paradigm
The role mentions "Apache Spark (PySpark)" for distributed data processing, "ETL pipelines", and "Big Data Technologies: Hadoop, HDFS, Kafka". Kafka suggests streaming capabilities, but the overall focus seems to be on batch processing with ETL pipelines.

**Inference**: "batch" - confidence 0.7

### orchestrator_category
No specific orchestrator mentioned in the job posting. The description focuses on Spark, ETL, and data processing but doesn't mention Airflow, Databricks workflows, or other orchestration tools.

**Inference**: "not_mentioned" - confidence 0.9

### storage_layer
The role mentions "data warehousing concepts" and "Big Data Technologies" with Hadoop/HDFS. This suggests a data warehouse focus, though the big data technologies could also imply data lake patterns.

**Inference**: "warehouse" - confidence 0.7

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
Pass 1 shows "ext_work_model_stated": "onsite" and "ext_location_restriction_text": "Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India". This is clearly onsite in a specific location.

**Inference**: "same_region" - confidence 0.9

### timezone_focus
The location is Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India, which would be India timezone (IST). Since it's a specific location requirement, this suggests a specific country focus.

**Inference**: "specific_country" - confidence 0.9

### relocation_required
The job is specifically located in "Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India" and requires onsite work. This suggests relocation would be required for someone not already in that location.

**Inference**: true - confidence 0.8

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
Pass 1 shows "ext_visa_sponsorship_stated": "not_mentioned". No mention of visa sponsorship.

**Inference**: false - confidence 0.9

### opt_cpt_friendly
No mention of student visa support or OPT/CPT in the job posting.

**Inference**: false - confidence 0.8

### citizenship_required
No specific citizenship requirements mentioned. The role is in India, so likely requires work authorization in India, but no specific citizenship restrictions stated.

**Inference**: "work_auth_only" - confidence 0.7

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
This is a full-time position at IBM, which would typically be W2 employment. No mention of contract work or 1099.

**Inference**: "w2" - confidence 0.9

### benefits_level
Pass 1 shows "ext_benefits_mentioned": [] - no benefits mentioned in the job posting.

**Inference**: "none_mentioned" - confidence 0.9

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
The job posting doesn't mention career paths, growth opportunities, or advancement potential. It's focused on current role responsibilities.

**Inference**: "not_mentioned" - confidence 0.9

### mentorship_signals
No mention of mentorship programs, working with senior people, or collaborative learning environments.

**Inference**: "not_mentioned" - confidence 0.9

### promotion_path_mentioned
No mention of promotions, advancement, or career progression.

**Inference**: false - confidence 0.9

### internal_mobility_mentioned
No mention of internal transfers, role changes, or mobility opportunities.

**Inference**: false - confidence 0.9

### career_tracks_available
No career tracks mentioned at all.

**Inference**: [] - confidence 0.9

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
The job posting has a clear list of "Required Technical And Professional Expertise" and "Preferred Technical And Professional Experience". The required section has specific technical skills, while the preferred section has additional nice-to-have items. This suggests medium strictness.

**Inference**: "medium" - confidence 0.8

### scope_definition
The job posting is focused specifically on data engineering responsibilities - "development, design of application", "ETL pipelines, data modeling, and data warehousing", "distributed data processing". It's not trying to combine multiple roles.

**Inference**: "clear" - confidence 0.9

### skill_inflation_detected
The skills required (Spark, PySpark, Python, SQL, cloud platforms) are appropriate for a data engineering role. No unrealistic combinations or excessive years of experience mentioned.

**Inference**: false - confidence 0.8

Now let me compile this into the required JSON format.
