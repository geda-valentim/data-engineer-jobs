2. **Work Authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. So visa_sponsorship_stated = "not_mentioned" and work_auth_text = null, citizenship_text = null. No security clearance mentioned, so security_clearance_stated = "not_mentioned".

3. **Work Model**: The location is "Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India" which suggests onsite work. No mention of remote or hybrid work options. So work_model_stated = "onsite". employment_type_stated is not explicitly mentioned, so "not_mentioned".

I'll continue analyzing the soft skills and technical requirements. The role demands strong communication and analytical abilities, with a focus on BI and data warehousing projects. The candidate needs proven expertise in reporting, visualization, and data integration across multiple platforms.
