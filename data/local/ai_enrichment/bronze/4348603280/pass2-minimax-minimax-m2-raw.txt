<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting step by step to infer the required characteristics.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting:**
- Title: Data Engineer-Business Intelligence
- Company: IBM
- Location: Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India
- This is for IBM Consulting Client Innovation Centers (Delivery Centers)
- Focus on BI/DW projects, reporting and visualization using Cognos
- 3+ years experience required
- Education: MCA/M.Tech/B.Tech/B.E. required
- Must have: Cognos Developer & Admin, UNIX
- Nice to have: AWS, Google, Azure, IBM InfoSphere DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica PowerCenter
- Soft skills: Communication, Time Management, Multi-tasking, Critical Thinking
- Onsite role in Navi Mumbai

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- Onsite work model
- Location: Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra, India
- 3 years minimum experience
- Education: Masters level required
- Must have skills: Cognos Developer, Admin, UNIX
- Nice to have: AWS, Google, Azure, IBM InfoSphere DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica PowerCenter
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No benefits mentioned
- No salary information

Now let me make inferences for each category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

**seniority_level:**
- Title: "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" (no "Senior" in title)
- Experience: 3 years minimum
- This suggests mid-level rather than senior
- For BI/Data Engineer roles, 3 years is typically mid-level
- Confidence: 0.7 (title doesn't specify seniority but 3 years suggests mid-level)
- Value: "mid"

**job_family:**
- Title explicitly says "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence"
- Focus on BI/DW projects, reporting and visualization
- This is clearly a BI-focused data engineer role
- Confidence: 0.95 (explicit in title)


- Value: "bi_engineer"

**sub_specialty:**
- Role focuses on BI/DW projects, reporting and visualization
- Uses Cognos for reporting
- ETL tools mentioned (DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica)
- This is clearly business intelligence and reporting focused
- Confidence: 0.9
- Value: "bi_engineering"

**leadership_expectation:**
- No mention of team leadership, mentoring, or direct reports
- Role focuses on individual contributor work: analysis, requirements, design, development
- No management responsibilities mentioned
- Confidence: 0.85
- Value: "ic"

I'll continue analyzing the cloud and infrastructure aspects of this role. The position requires expertise across multiple cloud platforms, with a strong emphasis on business intelligence and data engineering. The role demands technical versatility, working with various ETL tools and cloud services while maintaining a focus on reporting and visualization.

The processing approach appears hybrid, combining batch processing for scheduled reports with potential real-time data integration. The primary cloud strategy seems multi-cloud, given the explicit mention of AWS, Google, and Azure as preferred technical skills.

The role's geographic constraints are specific - onsite in Navi Mumbai, with no remote work flexibility. This suggests a localized, in-person collaboration model for the IBM Consulting team.

Regarding work authorization, the position requires standard work eligibility in India, with no special visa sponsorship mentioned. The employment structure indicates a full-time W2 arrangement, though specific compensation details remain unspecified.

Career development opportunities seem limited, with no explicit growth paths, mentorship programs, or internal mobility signals. The requirements suggest a focused, execution-oriented role with clear technical expectations but minimal strategic career progression.

The skill requirements appear balanced - not overly restrictive, with a clear distinction between mandatory and preferred qualifications. The role scope is precisely defined, targeting business intelligence and data engineering without unnecessary complexity.

Notably, the skill set aligns appropriately with the mid-level position, avoiding unrealistic or inflated expectations.
