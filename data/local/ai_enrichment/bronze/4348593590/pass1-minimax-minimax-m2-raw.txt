<reasoning>I need to carefully extract information from this job posting following the strict rules provided. Let me go through the job posting systematically and extract only explicitly stated information.

Looking at the job posting:

**Title**: Data Scientist-Advanced Analytics
**Company**: IBM
**Location**: Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India

Let me analyze each section:

1. **Compensation**: No salary information is mentioned, so all compensation fields should be null.

2. **Work Authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. No security clearance mentioned either.

3. **Work Model**: The location is specified as "Bengaluru East, Karnataka, India" which suggests onsite work, but the posting doesn't explicitly state the work model. I should use "not_mentioned" for work_model_stated. Employment type is not explicitly mentioned.

4. **Contract Details**: No contract information is provided - no mention of contract type, duration, etc.

5. **Contractor Rates**: Not applicable as this doesn't appear to be a contractor position.

6. **Skills Classification**: Let me analyze the skills mentioned:

**Required Technical And Professional Expertise**:
- Proof of Concept (POC) Development
- Gen AI code assistant capabilities
- Document solution architectures
- Stay up to date with AI, foundation models, and large language models
- Evaluate emerging technologies

**Preferred Technical And Professional Experience**:
- Experience in COBOL & JAVA (preferred)
- Code generation, code matching & code translation leveraging LLM capabilities (big plus)
- Growth mindset to understand clients' business processes

For hard skills classification:
- "Proof of Concept (POC) Development" - this seems like a must-have as it's in "Required" section
- "Gen AI code assistant capabilities" - must-have as it's in "Required" 
- "Document solution architectures" - must-have as it's in "Required"
- "Stay up to date with AI, foundation models, and large language models" - must-have as it's in "Required"


- "Evaluate emerging technologies" - must-have as it's in "Required"
- "COBOL & JAVA" - nice-to-have as it's marked as "preferred"
- "Code generation, code matching & code translation leveraging LLM capabilities" - nice-to-have as it's marked as "big plus"
- "Growth mindset to understand clients' business processes" - this is more of a soft skill
