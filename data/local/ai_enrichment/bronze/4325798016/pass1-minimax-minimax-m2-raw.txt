<reasoning>Let me carefully analyze this job posting to extract the required information. I need to go through each section systematically and extract only what is explicitly stated.

Looking at the job posting:

**Title**: Application Developer-Process Management (BPM)
**Company**: IBM
**Location**: Mumbai Metropolitan Region

Let me go through each section:

1. **Compensation**: No salary information is mentioned in the job posting. So all compensation fields should be null.

2. **Work Authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. So this should be "not_mentioned".

3. **Work Model**: 
   - Location is "Mumbai Metropolitan Region" - this suggests onsite work
   - No mention of remote or hybrid work
   - No mention of employment type (full-time, contract, etc.)
   - So work_model_stated should be "onsite" since location is specified
   - employment_type_stated should be "not_mentioned"

4. **Contract Details**: No mention of contract type, duration, etc. So all should be null/not_mentioned.

5. **Contractor Rates**: No mention of contractor rates. So all should be null/not_mentioned.

6. **Skills Classified**: Let me analyze the skills mentioned:

**Must-have hard skills** (based on strong qualifiers like "minimum of 3 years", "good understanding", "strong working knowledge"):
- Appian software development (mentioned twice with "minimum of 3 years")
- Database concepts (good understanding)
- Oracle SQL, Server MySQL (strong working knowledge)
- BPM tools (IBM BPM, Pega, Camunda)
- Business process workflows
- APIs and web services
- BPM applications troubleshooting, testing, optimization

**Nice-to-have hard skills** (based on preferred experience):
- 5-7 years of experience in BPM (this is preferred experience)
- 2+ years of experience with Appian (this is preferred experience)

**Soft skills**:
- "Ability to communicate results to technical and non-technical audiences" - this is a must-have soft skill with strong qualifier
 
I'll continue analyzing the experience and education requirements. The role demands a minimum of 3 years of recent experience, with a preferred range of 5-7 years in BPM. The education requirement is a Master's Degree, which is explicitly stated as preferred. This suggests the company values advanced academic credentials but doesn't make them mandatory for the role.
