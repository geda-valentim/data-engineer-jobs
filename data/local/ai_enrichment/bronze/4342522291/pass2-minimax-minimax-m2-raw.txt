Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Data Architect & Leader" - this is clearly a senior-level role
- Compensation: $140k-$170k is senior level for data roles
- Leading a team (mentor/leadership responsibilities)

- This is clearly a senior role, likely staff or principal level given the leadership component
- Confidence: 0.9 (strong signals from title, compensation, and responsibilities)

### job_family
- Title: "Data Architect & Leader"
- Core responsibilities: architectural design, ETL processes, data environment optimization
- This is clearly a data architect role
- Confidence: 0.95 (explicit in title and responsibilities)

### sub_specialty
- Focus on Microsoft environment (MS Fabric, Power BI)


- ERP integrations with Salesforce, Procore, Sage Intacct
- AI applications and practical AI experience
- This appears to be a general data architecture role with AI/ML integration
- Confidence: 0.7 (moderate inference from AI and integration focus)

### leadership_expectation
- "player-coach" role explicitly mentioned
- Leading a small team (Data Engineer and Data Scientist)
- Mentoring responsibilities
