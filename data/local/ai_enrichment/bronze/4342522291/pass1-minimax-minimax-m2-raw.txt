Let me double-check my classification of skills according to the rules:

For hard skills, I need to look at qualifiers:
- "Proven experience as a Data Architect" - "proven" is a strong qualifier, so must_have
- "Strong integration background" - "strong" is a strong qualifier, so must_have
- "Practical, applied AI experience" - "practical, applied" are strong qualifiers, so must_have

For soft skills:
- "Leadership experience" - "leadership experience" is a strong qualifier, so must_have
- "collaborative style" - mentioned as part of leadership requirement, so must_have

The job mentions AI applications and agents/copilots, which would fall under LLM/GenAI, so llm_genai_mentioned should be true.

Now let me count the fields and create the final JSON.
