<reasoning>Let me carefully analyze this job posting to extract the required information according to the rules. I need to go through each section systematically.

First, let me identify the key information:

**Title**: Data Engineer
**Company**: Accenture in India
**Location**: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India

Now let me go through each section:

1. **Compensation**: No salary information is mentioned in the posting, so salary_disclosed = false and all salary fields should be null.

2. **Work Authorization**: No mention of visa sponsorship, work authorization requirements, or citizenship requirements. So visa_sponsorship_stated = "not_mentioned" and work_auth_text = null.

3. **Work Model**: 
   - Location is specified as "Bengaluru, Karnataka, India" but no mention of remote/hybrid/onsite work model
   - No employment type mentioned (full-time, contract, etc.)
   - So work_model_stated = "not_mentioned"

4. **Contract Details**: No mention of contract type, duration, etc. So contract_type = "not_mentioned"

5. **Contractor Rates**: No mention of contractor rates, so pay_type = "not_mentioned"

6. **Skills Classification**: Let me analyze the skills mentioned:

   **Must have skills**: "Databricks Unified Data Analytics Platform" - this is explicitly stated as "Must have skills"
   
   **Good to have skills**: "NA" - so no nice-to-have skills mentioned
   
   **Experience**: "Minimum 5 Year(s) Of Experience Is Required" and later "The candidate should have a minimum of 6 years of experience in Databricks Unified Data Analytics Platform"
   - years_experience_min: 5 (from the main requirement)
   - years_experience_max: null
   - years_experience_text: "Minimum 5 Year(s) Of Experience Is Required"
   
   **Education**: "15 years full time education is required"
   - This means 15 years of education, which typically means a bachelor's degree (12 years of schooling + 3 years of college)
   - education_level: "BACHELORS" (inferred from 15 years)
   - education_area: null (no specific field mentioned)
   - education_requirement: "required"
   - education_text_raw: "15 years full time education is required"
   
   **Technical Skills mentioned**:
   - Py Spark, Spark
   - AWS, Azure, GCP
   - Big Data architectures
   - S3, Blob Storage, Big Query, Redshift
   - Apache Airflow
   - Parquet, Avro, JSON
   - Python
   - SQL
   - Kafka
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - DBT
   - Informatica, Talend, Matillion
   
   I need to classify these skills based on the qualifiers used. Looking at the text:
   - "Strong proficiency in Py Spark, Spark" - strong qualifier = must_have
   - "Understanding of Big Data architectures" - no strong qualifier, but in technical skills section = must_have
   - "Familiarity with cloud-native data storage solutions" - weak qualifier = nice_to_have
   - "Experience with data orchestration tools like Apache Airflow" - no strong qualifier = must_have
   - "Knowledge of data formats like Parquet, Avro, or JSON" - no strong qualifier = must_have
   - "Strong coding skills in Python" - strong qualifier = must_have
   - "Good understanding of SQL" - weak qualifier = nice_to_have
   - "Experience with real-time data processing and Kafka" - no strong qualifier = must_have
   - "Exposure to CI/CD pipelines" - weak qualifier = nice_to_have
   - "Familiarity with DBT" - weak qualifier = nice_to_have
   - "Experience with other ETL tools" - no strong qualifier = must_have

   I'll continue analyzing the skills, focusing on the qualifiers and context to determine their classification. The key is to distinguish between must-have and nice-to-have skills based on the language used in the job description.

   The soft skills section reveals collaborative and communication requirements. Teamwork, collaboration, and problem-solving emerge as critical competencies. These skills are essential for working effectively in a data engineering environment, requiring strong interpersonal and analytical capabilities.

   The job description emphasizes cross-functional collaboration, highlighting the need for professionals who can work seamlessly across different teams and technical domains. Problem-solving and troubleshooting skills are particularly valued, indicating a need for individuals who can navigate complex technical challenges.

   No specific certifications are mentioned, and the role does not involve language model or generative AI technologies. The position focuses on traditional data engineering skills and cloud platform expertise.

   Geographic restrictions are not specified, suggesting a flexible approach to candidate location. The role appears to be open to global talent, with no explicit limitations on work authorization or regional constraints.

   Benefits are not detailed in the provided context, leaving compensation and additional perks unspecified. The company description is minimal, providing only basic information about Accenture's presence in India.

   The extraction process reveals a comprehensive data engineering role requiring diverse technical competencies across cloud platforms, data processing, and collaborative problem-solving.
