<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting for a Data Engineer position at Accenture in India. I need to go through each inference category systematically.

First, let me understand the job posting:
- Title: Data Engineer
- Company: Accenture in India
- Location: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India
- Experience required: Minimum 5 years
- Education: 15 years full time education (bachelor's degree)
- Core focus: Databricks, PySpark, Spark, ETL processes, data pipelines
- Cloud platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP mentioned
- Tools: Apache Airflow, Kafka, DBT, various ETL tools

Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Data Engineer" (no "Senior" prefix)
- Experience: Minimum 5 years required
- Looking at the IC hierarchy: intern < entry < associate < junior < mid < senior < staff < principal < distinguished
- 5 years typically maps to senior level in data engineering
- However, the title doesn't have "Senior" prefix, which suggests mid-level
- The responsibilities are quite advanced (designing data platforms, optimizing pipelines, etc.)
- Confidence: This is tricky. The experience requirement suggests senior level, but the title doesn't have "Senior" prefix. I'll go with "senior" based on the 5+ years requirement and advanced responsibilities.

### job_family
- Title is clearly "Data Engineer"
- Core responsibilities are building data pipelines, ETL processes, data platform work
- This is clearly data_engineer family
- Confidence: Very high

### sub_specialty
- Mentions both real-time streaming ("real-time streaming data pipelines") and batch processing ("batch data processing")
- Mentions Kafka for real-time
- Mentions ETL/ELT processes which are typically batch
- This is clearly hybrid processing paradigm
- Confidence: High

### leadership_expectation
- No mention of direct reports
- No mention of managing people


- Mentions working "as part of the data engineering team"
- Mentions collaborating with other engineers
- This suggests pure IC role with no leadership responsibilities
- Confidence: High

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
- Mentions "AWS, Azure, or GCP" as options
- No clear primary cloud mentioned
- All three are mentioned as options for "major cloud platforms"
- This suggests multi-cloud approach
- Confidence: High

### secondary_clouds
- Since primary is multi, secondary would be the other clouds mentioned
- But since it's multi, secondary_clouds should be empty array
- Confidence: High

### processing_paradigm
- Explicitly mentions both "real-time streaming data pipelines" and "batch data processing"
- Mentions Kafka for real-time
- Mentions ETL/ELT processes which are typically batch
- This is clearly hybrid
- Confidence: High

### orchestrator_category
- Mentions "Apache Airflow or similar" explicitly
- Airflow is clearly airflow_like category
- Confidence: Very high

### storage_layer
- Mentions "data lakes" for unstructured data
- Mentions "cloud-native data storage solutions such as S3, Blob Storage, Big Query, or Redshift"
- S3, Blob Storage are lake storage
- Big Query, Redshift are warehouse storage
- This suggests mixed storage approach
- Confidence: High

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
- Location is specified as "Bengaluru, Karnataka, India"
- No mention of remote work
- No mention of relocation
- This suggests on-site work in Bengaluru
- But the job posting doesn't explicitly state remote restrictions
- I need to be careful here - the posting doesn't mention remote work at all
- Since no remote work is mentioned and location is specified, this suggests same_region restriction
- Confidence: Medium

### timezone_focus
- Location is Bengaluru, India
- No timezone requirements mentioned
- This would be India timezone (IST)
- But no specific timezone focus mentioned
- Confidence: Low - use "not_mentioned"

### relocation_required
- Location is specified as Bengaluru, Karnataka, India
- No mention of relocation assistance or requirements
- The job is based in Bengaluru, so no relocation needed
- Confidence: High

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION

### h1b_friendly
- This is an Indian company (Accenture in India)
- No mention of visa sponsorship
- Since it's in India, H1B (US visa) wouldn't be relevant
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- Confidence: High for false

### opt_cpt_friendly
- This is an Indian company
- OPT/CPT are US student visa programs
- Not relevant for Indian company
- No mention of student visa support
- Confidence: High for false

### citizenship_required
- No citizenship requirements mentioned
- This is an Indian company hiring in India
- Would be work authorization for India
- But the posting doesn't specify
- Confidence: Low - use "not_mentioned"

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION

### w2_vs_1099
- This appears to be a full-time position at Accenture
- No mention of contract work
- No mention of 1099 or C2C
- This suggests W2 employment
- But the posting doesn't explicitly state employment type
- Confidence: Medium

### benefits_level
- No benefits mentioned in the job posting
- No equity, PTO, health insurance, etc. mentioned
- This suggests none_mentioned
- Confidence: High

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT

### growth_path_clarity
- No mention of career paths, growth opportunities, advancement
- No mention of promotion tracks
- This suggests not_mentioned
- Confidence: High

### mentorship_signals
- No mention of mentorship programs
- Mentions working with other engineers but no senior mentorship
- No mentorship signals
- Confidence: High

### promotion_path_mentioned
- No mention of promotion or advancement
- No mention of career growth
- Confidence: High for false

### internal_mobility_mentioned
- No mention of internal transfers or role changes
- No mention of exploring different roles
- Confidence: High for false

### career_tracks_available
- No mention of IC track, management track, etc.
- No career track information
- Confidence: Low - use empty array

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION

### requirement_strictness
- Clear distinction between "Must have skills" and "Good to have skills"
- "Must have" section has specific technical requirements
- "Good to have" section is empty (NA)
- This suggests high strictness for must-haves
- But the good to have section is empty
- Confidence: Medium

### scope_definition
- Clear job description focused on data engineering
- Single clear role (Data Engineer)
- Well-defined responsibilities around data pipelines, ETL, etc.
- Not multi-role hybrid
- Confidence: High

### skill_inflation_detected
- 5 years experience requirement for data engineer role
- Skills mentioned are appropriate for data engineering
- No unrealistic skill combinations
- Reasonable expectations for the role level
- Confidence: High for false

Let me now compile this into the JSON format.
