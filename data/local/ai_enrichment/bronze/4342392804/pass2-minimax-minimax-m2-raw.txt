Now let me make inferences following the rules:

**SENIORITY AND ROLE:**
1. **seniority_level**: The title is "Sr Data Engineer" and requires 5+ years experience. This clearly indicates "senior" level. Confidence should be high (0.9+).


2. **job_family**: The role is clearly a data engineer position, focusing on data pipelines and cloud platforms. I'll classify this as a standard data engineering role with high confidence.
3. **sub_specialty**: The job involves batch ETL processes, with no specific streaming or real-time requirements mentioned. This suggests a general data engineering approach.
4. **leadership_expectation**: The role involves mentoring junior engineers and providing technical leadership, indicating a tech lead individual contributor position.

**STACK AND CLOUD:**
1. **primary_cloud**: The job mentions multiple cloud platforms - AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse, and GCP BigQuery. This suggests a multi-cloud approach, which requires careful architectural consideration.
2. **secondary_clouds**: The presence of multiple cloud platforms indicates a diverse cloud strategy beyond a single provider.
3. **processing_paradigm**: The job description focuses on ETL workflows and data pipelines, which typically involve batch processing.
4. **orchestrator_category**: Apache Airflow is explicitly mentioned as a workflow orchestration tool, pointing to an Airflow-like approach.
5. **storage_layer**: The mention of multiple cloud data warehouses suggests a warehouse-focused storage strategy.

**GEO AND WORK MODEL:**
1. **remote_restriction**: The role is strictly onsite in Minneapolis, MN, with no remote work options.
2. **timezone_focus**: The specific location implies a focus on the Americas timezone.
3. **relocation_required**: The onsite requirement suggests potential relocation needs for candidates outside Minneapolis.

**VISA AND AUTHORIZATION:**
1. **h1b_friendly**: The E-Verify status and lack of explicit sponsorship language suggests potential limitations for visa holders.
2. **opt_cpt_friendly**: Work authorization requirements likely exclude student visa holders.
3. **citizenship_required**: The role appears to require standard work authorization without specific citizenship restrictions.

**CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION:**
1. **w2_vs_1099**: The full-time, permanent position strongly indicates a W2 employment structure.
2. **benefits_level**: The comprehensive benefits package, including equity and learning opportunities, suggests a robust compensation approach.

**CAREER DEVELOPMENT:**
1. **growth_path_clarity**: The role implies career advancement opportunities through mentorship and technical leadership.
2. **mentorship_signals**: Explicit mentorship programs are highlighted as a key employee development strategy.
3. **promotion_path_mentioned**: Promotional opportunities are directly referenced in the benefits section.
4. **internal_mobility_mentioned**: No specific internal mobility programs are outlined.
5. **career_tracks_available**: The role suggests potential progression through individual contributor and management tracks.

**REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION:**
1. **requirement_strictness**: The role maintains a balanced approach with clear must-have and preferred qualifications.
2. **scope_definition**: The position demonstrates a focused data engineering scope with well-defined responsibilities.
3. **skill_inflation_detected**: The skill requirements align appropriately with senior-level expectations, avoiding unrealistic demands.
