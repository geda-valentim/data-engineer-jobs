<reasoning>Let me analyze the job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting:**
- Title: Data Engineer-Business Intelligence
- Company: IBM
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- This is for IBM Consulting Client Innovation Centers (Delivery Centers)
- Focus on BI/DW projects, reporting and visualization using Cognos
- 3+ years experience required
- Master's degree preferred
- Skills: Cognos Developer & Admin, UNIX, cloud platforms (AWS, Google, Azure), ETL tools (IBM InfoSphere DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica PowerCenter)

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- Work model: onsite
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- 3 years minimum experience
- Education: Master's preferred
- Must-have skills: Cognos, UNIX, AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM InfoSphere DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica PowerCenter
- Soft skills: Communication, Time Management, Multi-tasking, Problem Solving, Critical Thinking, Team Collaboration
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No benefits mentioned
- No salary information

Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" (no "Senior" in title)
- Experience: 3 years minimum
- Looking at the IC hierarchy: intern < entry < associate < junior < mid < senior < staff < principal < distinguished
- 3 years typically maps to "mid" level (mid-level is usually 3-5 years)
- No "Senior" in title, but 3 years suggests mid-level
- Confidence: 0.7-0.9 (title OR years match strongly) → 0.8

### job_family
- Title: "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence"


- Responsibilities focus on BI/DW projects, reporting, and visualization
- Core activities involve analysis, requirements gathering, design, and report development
- This aligns perfectly with the data engineering role, specifically in business intelligence
- Confidence: 0.9 (directly from title and responsibilities)

### sub_specialty
- Focus on BI/DW projects, reporting, and visualization
- ETL tools mentioned: IBM InfoSphere DataStage, Azure Data Factory, Informatica PowerCenter
- This suggests batch ETL and data warehouse focus
- Not streaming/realtime mentioned
- Confidence: 0.8 (batch ETL focus)

### leadership_expectation
- No mention of team leadership, mentoring, or direct reports
- Focus on individual contributor work: analysis, requirements, design, development
- No "lead" or "senior" in title
- This suggests pure IC role
- Confidence: 0.8 (no leadership signals)

I'll analyze the cloud and processing characteristics, noting the multi-cloud approach and batch processing focus. The role emphasizes traditional data engineering methods with a strong emphasis on business intelligence and data warehousing.

The work model reveals a specific onsite requirement in Pune, with no remote flexibility. This suggests a traditional, in-person work environment focused on local collaboration and direct client interaction.

Visa and authorization details indicate a standard employment approach, with no special sponsorship or unique work authorization requirements. The role appears to target local talent with standard work eligibility.

Contract and compensation details point to a traditional employment structure, likely full-time with standard benefits. The absence of specific contract information suggests a conventional employment arrangement.

Career development signals are minimal, with no explicit growth paths or mentorship programs mentioned. The role seems to prioritize individual contribution over structured professional advancement.

Requirements classification suggests a focused, well-defined role with clear technical expectations. The skill set appears balanced, avoiding unrealistic or inflated technical demands.
