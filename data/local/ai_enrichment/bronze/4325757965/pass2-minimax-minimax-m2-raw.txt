<reasoning>Let me analyze the job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting Analysis:**
- Title: "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" 
- Company: IBM
- Location: Pune, Maharashtra, India
- This is for an Application Developer role in IBM Consulting Client Innovation Centers
- Focus on Tableau, SQL, Oracle, Hive
- Master's degree required
- On-site work model
- No salary information disclosed
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No specific years of experience mentioned

**Pass 1 Extraction Results:**
- Work model: onsite
- Education: Master's degree required
- Must-have skills: Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server, SQL, Oracle, Hive, Tableau dashboards, analytics, etc.
- Soft skills: Communication, Project Management, Multitasking, Collaborative Skills
- No benefits mentioned
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No years of experience specified

Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE INFERENCE

### seniority_level
The title is "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" but the responsibilities mention "lead IBM into the future", "transform vital business needs into code", "manage end to end feature development", "manage debugging, finding root cause analysis". These are responsibilities that suggest a mid to senior level role. However, no specific years of experience are mentioned. The Master's degree requirement suggests this might be for entry-level or early career, but the responsibilities are quite advanced. Given the lack of specific years and the advanced responsibilities, I'll infer this as "mid" level with moderate confidence.

### job_family
The title clearly indicates "Data Engineer-Business Intelligence" and the focus is on Tableau, SQL, data analysis, and dashboard development. This is clearly an analytics engineer role focused on business intelligence. The core responsibilities involve data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence tools.

### sub_specialty
The role focuses on Tableau, SQL, Oracle, Hive, and dashboard development. 

The data processing approach centers on batch processing, with a clear emphasis on analytics and business intelligence. The tools and technologies suggest a specialized focus on structured data analysis and reporting, rather than real-time or streaming data processing.

### leadership_expectation
The responsibilities include "lead IBM into the future", "manage end to end feature development", and "manage debugging". This suggests some level of technical leadership, but no mention of direct reports or people management. This points to a tech lead IC role.

## STACK AND CLOUD INFERENCE

### primary_cloud
No specific cloud providers are mentioned in the job posting. The technologies mentioned (Tableau, SQL, Oracle, Hive) could be on-premise or cloud-based, but no specific cloud services are referenced. This should be "not_mentioned".

### secondary_clouds
Since no clouds are mentioned, this should be an empty array.

### processing_paradigm
The role focuses on Tableau dashboards, SQL queries, and data analysis. This suggests batch processing for analytics and reporting rather than real-time streaming. The mention of "large data sets" and "workbook performance" suggests batch processing.

### orchestrator_category
No specific orchestration tools are mentioned. The role seems to focus more on analytics and dashboard development rather than pipeline orchestration.

### storage_layer
The technologies mentioned (SQL, Oracle, Hive) suggest traditional data warehousing and database systems. Oracle and SQL databases point to warehouse-style storage, while Hive suggests data warehouse/lake patterns.

## GEO AND WORK MODEL INFERENCE

### remote_restriction
The job posting clearly states "onsite" work model and is located in "Pune, Maharashtra, India". This suggests a same_region restriction (Pune area) with onsite requirement.

### timezone_focus
The location is Pune, India, which would be IST timezone. However, since this is an onsite role in India, the timezone focus would be India/Asia region.

### relocation_required
Since this is an onsite role in Pune, India, and no relocation package is mentioned, this would be false - you need to already be in Pune or willing to relocate there.

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION INFERENCE

### h1b_friendly
No visa sponsorship is mentioned, and this is an India-based role. H1B is a US visa, so this doesn't apply. The role is in India, so this should be false or not_mentioned.

### opt_cpt_friendly
This is an India-based role, so US student visa programs don't apply. Should be false.

### citizenship_required
Since this is an India-based role, the citizenship requirements would be for India. No specific citizenship requirements are mentioned, so this would be "work_auth_only" or "any" for India.

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION INFERENCE

### w2_vs_1099
This appears to be a full-time employee position at IBM, so this would be W2.

### benefits_level
No benefits are mentioned in the job posting, so this should be "none_mentioned".

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT INFERENCE

### growth_path_clarity
The job posting mentions "a limitless career path with the world's technology leader" which suggests growth opportunities, but doesn't specify clear career tracks. This would be "implied".

### mentorship_signals
No specific mentorship program is mentioned, but working in IBM Consulting and collaborating with teams suggests some level of mentorship through collaboration.

### promotion_path_mentioned
No specific promotion path is mentioned, so this would be false.

### internal_mobility_mentioned
No mention of internal transfers or mobility, so false.

### career_tracks_available
No specific career tracks are mentioned, so this would be an empty array or minimal.

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION INFERENCE

### requirement_strictness
The job has clear must-have skills (Tableau, SQL, etc.) and Master's degree requirement, but also mentions "Preferred Technical And Professional Experience: None" which suggests they are open to candidates without specific experience. This suggests medium strictness.

### scope_definition
The role is clearly defined as a Data Engineer-Business Intelligence role focused on Tableau and analytics. This is clear and focused.

### skill_inflation_detected
The requirements seem reasonable for a data engineer role - Tableau, SQL, communication skills. No obvious skill inflation detected.
