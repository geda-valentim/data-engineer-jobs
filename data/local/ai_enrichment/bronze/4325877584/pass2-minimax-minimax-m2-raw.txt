<reasoning>Let me analyze the job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting:**
- Title: Data Engineer-Data Integration
- Company: IBM
- Location: Kochi, Kerala, India
- Role: Data Engineer focusing on data gathering, storage, batch and real-time processing
- Required skills: Data warehousing, ETL (Informatica PowerCenter), Cloud, Power BI, Unix shell scripting, Python, SQL, Big Data
- Nice to have: MS-Azure Cloud, HDFC Bank EDW/SOR experience
- Work model: Onsite in Kochi, Kerala, India

**Pass 1 Extraction:**
- Work model: onsite
- Location: Kochi, Kerala, India
- Must have skills: Data warehousing, Information Management, Data Integration, Business Intelligence, ETL tool Informatica PowerCenter, Cloud, Power BI, Data migration on cloud, Unix shell scripting, Python, relational SQL, Big Data
- Nice to have: MS-Azure Cloud, HDFC Bank EDW/SOR
- No salary, visa, benefits, or experience requirements mentioned

Now let me make inferences for each field:

**SENIORITY AND ROLE:**
1. **seniority_level**: The title is "Data Engineer" without any seniority modifier. The skills required are quite comprehensive (data warehousing, ETL, cloud, programming, etc.) but no specific years of experience are mentioned. This suggests a mid-level role. Confidence around 0.6-0.7.

2. **job_family**: Clearly "data_engineer" based on the title and responsibilities.

3. **sub_specialty**: The role mentions both "batch and real-time processing" and "ETL tool Informatica PowerCenter" which suggests batch ETL focus. Also mentions "Data Integration" which aligns with batch ETL. Confidence around 0.8.
 
The leadership role appears to be a standard individual contributor position without explicit management responsibilities. The position seems focused on technical execution rather than team leadership, with no clear indication of mentoring or direct report management.

**STACK AND CLOUD:**
The cloud infrastructure suggests a multi-cloud approach, with Azure explicitly mentioned and a general "Cloud" requirement. The processing paradigm seems flexible, covering both batch and real-time data handling. The absence of specific orchestration tools points to a more generalized technical approach.

**GEO AND WORK MODEL:**
The role is strictly onsite in Kochi, Kerala, India, with no remote work flexibility. The timezone focus is clearly India-specific, and no relocation is needed since the position is already location-specific.

**VISA AND AUTHORIZATION:**
The position appears to require local work authorization, with no specific visa sponsorship mentioned. This suggests the role is intended for candidates already authorized to work in India.

**CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION:**
The employment type is not explicitly defined, but the onsite nature and corporate context imply a full-time W2 employment structure. Benefits are not detailed, leaving compensation specifics unclear.

**CAREER DEVELOPMENT:**
Career growth opportunities are not explicitly outlined, with no clear mentorship or promotion pathways mentioned. The role seems focused on immediate technical execution rather than long-term professional development.

**REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION:**
The skill requirements appear moderately strict, with a clear set of technical competencies expected. The role scope is well-defined, targeting data integration and engineering responsibilities without suggesting skill inflation or unrealistic expectations.
