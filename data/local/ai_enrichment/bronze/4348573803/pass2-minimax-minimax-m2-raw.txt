<reasoning>Let me analyze the job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer the job characteristics according to the rules provided.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting Analysis:**
- Title: "Data Engineer-Data Platforms" at IBM
- Location: Mumbai Metropolitan Region (India)
- Role: Application Developer with focus on Python, Spark, PySpark
- Experience: 6+ years overall, 4+ years with Python/Spark
- Education: Master's degree required
- Cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure mentioned as "good to have"
- Work model: Onsite (from Pass 1)
- Employment: Full-time permanent

**Pass 1 Extraction Key Points:**
- Work model: onsite
- Location: Mumbai Metropolitan Region
- Employment: full_time, permanent
- Must-have skills: Python, Spark, PySpark
- Nice-to-have: AWS, GCP, Azure
- Experience: 6+ years
- Education: Master's required
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No benefits mentioned
- No security clearance mentioned

Now let me infer each field:

**SENIORITY AND ROLE:**
1. **seniority_level**: 
   - 6+ years experience + "Data Engineer" title
   - This suggests senior level (typically 5-8 years for senior)
   - Confidence: 0.85 (strong inference from experience + title)
   - Source: combined

2. **job_family**: 
   - Title is "Data Engineer-Data Platforms"
   - Core skills: Python, Spark, PySpark
   - This is clearly data_engineer
   - Confidence: 0.95
   - Source: pass1_derived

3. **sub_specialty**: 
   - Focus on Spark/PySpark suggests batch processing
   - No streaming technologies mentioned
   - This points to batch_etl
   - Confidence: 0.75
   - Source: inferred

4. **leadership_expectation**: 
   - No mention of team leadership, mentoring, or direct reports
   - Role seems to be individual contributor focused
   - This suggests pure IC role
   - Confidence: 0.80
   - Source: inferred

**STACK AND CLOUD:**
1. **primary_cloud**: 
   - AWS, GCP, Azure all mentioned as "good to have"
   - No clear primary cloud preference
   - This suggests multi-cloud approach
   - Confidence: 0.80
   - Source: pass1_derived

2. **secondary_clouds**: 
   - Since all three are mentioned equally, no clear secondary
   - Empty array
   - Confidence: 0.90
   - Source: pass1_derived

3. **processing_paradigm**: 
   - Spark/PySpark mentioned as core skills
   - Spark can do both batch and streaming, but emphasis seems on batch ETL
   - No streaming technologies mentioned (no Kafka, Flink, etc.)
   - This suggests batch processing
   - Confidence: 0.75
   - Source: inferred

4. **orchestrator_category**: 
   - No specific orchestrator mentioned
   - Spark can be scheduled natively or with external orchestrators
   - No Airflow, dbt, etc. mentioned
   - This suggests spark_native or not_mentioned
   - Since Spark is primary, lean toward spark_native
   - Confidence: 0.70
   - Source: inferred

5. **storage_layer**: 
   - No specific data warehouse, lake, or lakehouse mentioned
   - Just mentions Spark/PySpark which can work with various storage
   - No Snowflake, Redshift, S3, etc. mentioned
   - This suggests not_mentioned
   - Confidence: 0.85
   - Source: pass1_derived

**GEO AND WORK MODEL:**
1. **remote_restriction**: 
   - Work model is "onsite"
   - Location: Mumbai Metropolitan Region
   - This suggests same_region restriction
   - Confidence: 0.85
   - Source: pass1_derived

2. **timezone_focus**: 
   - Location: Mumbai Metropolitan Region (India)
   - This suggests specific_country (India)
   - Confidence: 0.90
   - Source: pass1_derived

3. **relocation_required**: 
   - Onsite role in Mumbai Metropolitan Region
   - No mention of relocation package or requirement
   - Since it's already location-specific, relocation not required
   - Confidence: 0.80
   - Source: inferred

**VISA AND AUTHORIZATION:**
1. **h1b_friendly**: 
   - No visa sponsorship mentioned
   - Role is in India, so H1B (US visa) not relevant
   - This suggests false, but H1B is US-specific
   - For India role, this would be false/not applicable
   - Confidence: 0.90
   - Source: pass1_derived

2. **opt_cpt_friendly**: 
   - No mention of student visa support
   - Role in India, so US student visas not relevant
   - This suggests false
   - Confidence: 0.85
   - Source: inferred

3. **citizenship_required**: 
   - No citizenship requirements mentioned
   - Role in India, so likely work authorization for India
   - This suggests work_auth_only
   - Confidence: 0.80
