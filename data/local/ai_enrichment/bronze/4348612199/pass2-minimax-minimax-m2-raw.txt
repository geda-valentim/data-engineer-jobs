<reasoning>Let me analyze the job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to make inferences about the job characteristics.

First, let me understand what we have:

**Original Job Posting Analysis:**
- Title: "Data Engineer-Data Platforms-Google" at IBM
- Location: Hyderabad, Telangana, India
- Role: Associate Software Developer/Data Engineer
- Focus: Data gathering, storage, batch and real-time processing, database integration, ML/statistical models
- Technologies: Hadoop, GCP, Elasticsearch, Splunk, APIs
- Work model: Onsite (mentioned in Pass 1)
- Education: Master's degree required

**Pass 1 Extraction Key Points:**
- Work model: onsite
- Employment type: full_time
- Contract type: permanent
- Location restriction: specific_countries (India only)
- Must-have skills: Database development, Data Replication, API development, Elasticsearch, Splunk, Statistical models, ML, Big data processing, etc.
- Education: Master's required
- No salary, benefits, visa sponsorship mentioned
- No years of experience specified

Now let me make inferences for each category:

**SENIORITY AND ROLE:**
1. **seniority_level**: The title says "Associate Software Developer" which suggests entry to mid-level, but the responsibilities are quite advanced (database migration, leading teams, complex technical work). However, no years of experience mentioned. The "Associate" title suggests this might be more junior than senior. I'll go with "mid" level as the responsibilities are quite advanced but the title suggests not senior.

2. **job_family**: This is clearly a "data_engineer" - the title says Data Engineer and the responsibilities focus on data gathering, storage, processing, database integration, etc.

3. **sub_specialty**: The role mentions both batch and real-time processing, database migration (Hadoop to GCP), API development, enterprise search (Elasticsearch, Splunk). This seems like a general data engineering role rather than specialized in streaming or batch specifically. 

I'll classify this as a general data engineering role with broad technical responsibilities. The position requires versatile skills across multiple data engineering domains, indicating a comprehensive approach to data platform development.

**STACK AND CLOUD:**
1. **primary_cloud**: The job explicitly mentions "Hadoop to GCP" migration, indicating GCP as the primary cloud platform. This suggests a strong focus on Google Cloud infrastructure and services.

2. **secondary_clouds**: No other cloud platforms are mentioned, so the secondary clouds list will be empty.

3. **processing_paradigm**: The role involves both batch and real-time processing, which points to a hybrid approach to data handling and transformation.

4. **orchestrator_category**: No specific orchestration tools are mentioned, so this will be marked as "not_mentioned".

5. **storage_layer**: The job involves migrating from Hadoop to GCP, suggesting a mixed storage approach that includes both traditional and cloud-native data storage solutions.

**GEO AND WORK MODEL:**
1. **remote_restriction**: The job is restricted to India, specifically requiring onsite work in Hyderabad.

2. **timezone_focus**: The role is centered in India, with a specific focus on the Indian timezone.

3. **relocation_required**: Since the position is already located in Hyderabad and requires onsite work, no additional relocation is needed.

**VISA AND AUTHORIZATION:**
1. **h1b_friendly**: Not applicable, as this is an Indian role.

2. **opt_cpt_friendly**: Not applicable for the same reason.

3. **citizenship_required**: The role is open to Indian residents, with no specific citizenship restrictions mentioned.

**CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION:**
1. **w2_vs_1099**: The position is a full-time permanent role, likely using a standard employment contract.

2. **benefits_level**: No specific benefits are mentioned, so this will be marked as "not_mentioned".

**CAREER DEVELOPMENT:**
1. **growth_path_clarity**: The role description lacks clear career progression details.

2. **mentorship_signals**: No explicit mentorship opportunities are highlighted.

3. **promotion_path_mentioned**: No specific promotion pathway is described.

4. **internal_mobility_mentioned**: No information about internal role mobility is provided.

5. **career_tracks_available**: The available career tracks are not specified in the job description.

**REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION:**
1. **requirement_strictness**: The role has a mix of required and preferred qualifications, suggesting a medium level of requirement strictness.

2. **scope_definition**: The job focuses specifically on data engineering responsibilities.

3. **skill_inflation_detected**: The skill requirements appear reasonable and aligned with the role's technical demands.
