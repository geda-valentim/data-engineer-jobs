<reasoning>I need to analyze the original job posting and Pass 1 extraction results to infer job characteristics. Let me break this down systematically.

First, let me understand what I have:

1. Original job posting: This is for a "Data Engineer (모델링)" position at MUSINSA in Seoul, South Korea. The text is in Korean, so I'll need to translate key parts to understand the requirements.

2. Pass 1 extraction results: This gives me structured data about the job posting including skills, work model, benefits, etc.

Let me analyze each section:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE ANALYSIS

**seniority_level**: 
- The title is "Data Engineer" without explicit seniority indicators
- From Pass 1, I see must-have skills include SQL, Python, data modeling, workflow managers (Airflow, Luigi, Dagster, Prefect)
- Nice-to-have includes data quality tools, Great Expectations, Soda, Databricks
- No specific years of experience mentioned
- The role seems to be focused on data platform work, which typically requires some experience
- Looking at the Korean text, this appears to be a mid-to-senior level role given the complexity of responsibilities mentioned
- I should classify this as "mid" level since there's no explicit "Senior" in title but the requirements suggest substantial experience

**job_family**: 
- Title is clearly "Data Engineer"
- Core responsibilities involve data pipelines, data modeling, workflow management
- This is clearly a data_engineer role

**sub_specialty**: 
- From the description, they mention CDC (Change Data Capture), user behavior events, search data
- They work with data marts and key indicator tables
- They mention workflow managers like Airflow, Luigi, Dagster, Prefect
- This suggests batch ETL and data modeling focus
- No streaming/realtime mentioned specifically
- This would be "batch_etl" or "data_modeling"

**leadership_expectation**: 
- No mention of direct reports or people management
- No explicit technical leadership mentioned
- This appears to be a pure IC role
- "ic" would be appropriate

## STACK AND CLOUD ANALYSIS


I'll investigate the cloud infrastructure and data processing requirements. The role involves multiple workflow management tools, suggesting a flexible, multi-platform approach to data engineering. The absence of a specific cloud provider indicates potential hybrid or multi-cloud strategies, with a strong emphasis on batch processing and data modeling capabilities.

The data platform team seems to focus on establishing robust data infrastructure standards, collecting diverse data sources, and creating reliable data marts for business intelligence. Their approach emphasizes data quality and governance through comprehensive platform management.

The workflow management tools span multiple orchestration frameworks, indicating a need for versatile data pipeline management. The team appears to prioritize data reliability and systematic data processing across various sources.

Cloud infrastructure remains unspecified, suggesting potential flexibility in technology stack selection. The data processing approach leans towards batch processing, with a focus on creating structured data marts and key performance indicators.

The storage layer strategy seems to involve a mixed approach, potentially combining warehouse and lakehouse architectures to support diverse data management needs.

Geographically, the role is centered in Seoul, South Korea, with no explicit remote work options mentioned. The position appears to require local presence, likely involving full-time employment with standard Korean work authorization requirements.

Visa and employment details suggest a standard local hiring approach, with no specific international sponsorship indicated. The role seems designed for candidates already authorized to work in South Korea.

Contractually, the position appears to be a permanent full-time role, with a standard 3-month probation period. Benefits seem minimal, focusing primarily on the probationary salary structure.

Career development opportunities seem limited, with no explicit growth paths, mentorship programs, or internal mobility mentioned. The role appears to have a clear, defined scope within the data engineering domain, without significant skill inflation or unrealistic expectations.

The requirements suggest a focused, entry to mid-level position with straightforward technical expectations and a transparent hiring process.
