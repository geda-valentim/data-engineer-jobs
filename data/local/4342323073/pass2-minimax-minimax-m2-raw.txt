<reasoning>Let me analyze this job posting step by step to infer the required characteristics.

First, let me understand what I'm working with:

1. **Original Job Posting**: Software & Data Engineer - Palantir Foundry at Ursa Major in Berthoud, CO
2. **Pass 1 Extraction**: Contains structured data about salary, visa requirements, work model, etc.

Now I need to infer the characteristics based on the rules provided. Let me go through each section:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Software & Data Engineer" 
- Experience: "1-5 years of professional software development experience, 1+ years of data engineering experience"
- This is 1-5 years experience, which typically maps to mid-level (3-5 years) or junior-mid level. The title doesn't have "Senior" in it, so this is likely "mid" level.
- Confidence: 0.7-0.8 range since title doesn't specify seniority but experience suggests mid-level

### job_family
- Title clearly states "Software & Data Engineer"
- Responsibilities focus on "data pipelines and workflows", "data integrations", "data logic, lineage, and tooling"
- This is clearly a data_engineer role
- Confidence: 0.9+ since title and responsibilities align perfectly

### sub_specialty
- The role is specifically focused on Palantir Foundry platform
- Mentions "data pipelines and workflows", "data integrations", "Ontology objects"
- This seems to be more about general data engineering within the Palantir ecosystem rather than a specific specialty like streaming or batch
- I should use "general" or look for more specific patterns
- Actually, looking at the responsibilities, this seems to be about building applications within Palantir Foundry, which is more of a platform/data engineering role
- Let me use "general" as the specialty since it's not clearly focused on streaming, batch ETL, etc.

### leadership_expectation
- The role mentions "Collaborate with the Product Owner and other Software & Data Engineers"


- No direct reports mentioned
- No explicit leadership responsibilities
- This appears to be a pure individual contributor role with no management duties
- Confidence level suggests a straightforward IC position without team leadership expectations

## STACK AND CLOUD

### primary_cloud
- No specific cloud provider mentioned in the job posting
- Palantir Foundry is a platform that can run on multiple cloud providers
- No AWS, Azure, or GCP specifically mentioned
- This indicates a cloud-agnostic approach or potential on-premise deployment
- Confidence level suggests uncertainty about specific cloud infrastructure

### secondary_clouds
- No additional cloud providers referenced
- Minimal information about cloud technology stack
- Indicates a flexible, platform-agnostic data engineering approach

### processing_paradigm
- Responsibilities include "data pipelines and workflows"
- No explicit streaming or real-time processing mentioned
- Likely involves batch processing for data integration and workflow management
- Suggests a traditional data engineering approach focused on scheduled data movements

### orchestrator_category
- No specific orchestration tool explicitly mentioned
- Responsibilities involve "data pipelines and workflows"
- Could potentially use Palantir's internal orchestration capabilities
- Unclear which specific workflow management system will be employed

### storage_layer
- No detailed storage technology specified
- Responsibilities suggest data management within Palantir Foundry
- Likely involves platform-native data storage solutions
- Emphasis on data integration and workflow management

## GEO AND WORK MODEL

### remote_restriction
- Specific location requirement in Berthoud, CO
- On-site work model explicitly stated
- No remote work options indicated
- Strict geographic and work arrangement constraints

### timezone_focus
- Located in Colorado (Mountain Time Zone)
- No specific timezone requirements mentioned
- Likely follows local Mountain Time Zone operations
- Minimal timezone flexibility suggested

### relocation_required
