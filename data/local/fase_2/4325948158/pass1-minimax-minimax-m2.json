Let me go through each section systematically.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key information:\n\n**Title**: Data Engineer\n**Company**: Manchester Digital (but the description mentions AJ Bell, so this seems to be a job posting for AJ Bell through Manchester Digital)\n**Location**: Manchester, England, United Kingdom\n\nNow let me go through each section of the JSON structure:\n\n**Compensation**: \n- I need to look for salary information. The posting mentions \"Competitive starting salary\" but doesn't give specific numbers. So salary_disclosed would be false, and all salary fields would be null.\n\n**Work Authorization**:\n- I need to look for visa sponsorship or work authorization requirements. I don't see any explicit mention of visa sponsorship or work authorization requirements. The posting says \"AJ Bell is committed to providing an environment of mutual respect where equal employment opportunities are available to all applicants\" but doesn't specifically mention work authorization. So this would be \"not_mentioned\".\n\n**Work Model**:\n- The posting mentions \"Hybrid working\" and \"you'll spend a minimum of 50% of your working time per month in the office\". So work_model_stated would be \"hybrid\".\n- Location is Manchester, England, United Kingdom\n- Employment type: This appears to be a full-time position (no mention of contract work), so employment_type_stated would be \"full_time\".\n\n**Contract Details**:\n- This appears to be a permanent position (full-time role), so contract_type would be \"permanent\".\n- No specific contract duration mentioned, so contract_duration_months would be null.\n- No mention of start dates, probation periods, etc.\n\n**Contractor Rates**: \n- This is not a contractor position, so these fields would be mostly null.\n\n**Skills Classified**:\nLet me analyze the skills mentioned:\n\n**Must-have hard skills** (based on strong qualifiers or required sections):\n- \"Core Cloud data platforms (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)\" - mentioned as core technology\n- \"Data transformation technology such as DBT\" - core technology\n\n\n- \"Visual Studio Code\" - development environment\n- \"Python\" - programming language\n- \"CI automation systems such as Jenkins\" - core infrastructure\n- \"A git-based source control system such as BitBucket\" - required for development\n- \"Data Warehouse/Kimball methodology\" - core methodology\n- \"Data replication technology such as Fivetran HVR\" - core technology\n\nI'll continue identifying the technical skills and qualifications for this data engineering role.

The ideal candidate demonstrates self-motivation, adaptability, and a commitment to continuous learning. Previous experience in e-commerce or financial services would be advantageous, along with technical proficiencies in Docker, container orchestration, AWS infrastructure, and various database technologies.\n\nThe AI tools section suggests familiarity with cutting-edge technologies like CoPilot and Snowflake Cortex, indicating a forward-thinking and innovative approach to data engineering.\n\n**Geographic Restrictions**:\n- Location is specifically Manchester, England, United Kingdom\n- No explicit geographic restrictions mentioned beyond the location\n- geo_restriction_type would be \"uk_only\" since the location is specified as Manchester, UK\n\n**Benefits Structured**:\nThe benefits package appears comprehensive, including competitive starting salary, generous holiday entitlement ranging from 25 to 31 days, and flexible pension schemes with matched contributions up to 6%.
