- Nice-to-have: Manufacturing, Industrial Systems, IoT Data
- Years experience: 1-5 years software + 1+ years data
- Benefits: comprehensive (unlimited PTO, equity, health, etc.)

Now let me infer each field:

**SENIORITY AND ROLE:**

1. **seniority_level**: 
   - Title: "Software & Data Engineer" (no "Senior" in title)
   - Experience: 1-5 years software + 1+ years data engineering
   - This suggests mid-level rather than senior
   - For data engineering, 1-5 years is typically mid-level
   - Confidence: 0.7-0.8 (title doesn't have "senior" but experience suggests mid-level)
   - Value: "mid"

2. **job_family**:
   - Title explicitly says "Software & Data Engineer"
   - Core responsibilities: data pipelines, workflows, data integrations
   - This is clearly data engineering
   - Confidence: 0.95 (very clear from title and responsibilities)
   - Value: "data_engineer"

3. **sub_specialty**:
   - Focus on Palantir Foundry platform
   - Data pipelines and workflows
   - Manufacturing/industrial systems mentioned as nice-to-have
   - This seems like general data engineering with some manufacturing focus
   - Confidence: 0.6-0.7 (some signals but not very specific)
   - Value: "general"

4. **leadership_expectation**:
   - No mention of direct reports
   - No mention of mentoring or leading teams
   - Collaborative role with Product Owner and other engineers
   - This suggests pure IC role
   - Confidence: 0.8 (clear from job description)
   - Value: "ic"

**STACK AND CLOUD:**

1. **primary_cloud**:
   - No specific cloud provider mentioned
   - Palantir Foundry is mentioned but that's a platform, not a cloud
   - No AWS, Azure, GCP mentioned
   - This is tricky - Palantir Foundry could be cloud-based but not specified
   - Confidence: <0.5 (no clear signals)
   - Value: "not_mentioned"

2. **secondary_clouds**:
   - No clouds mentioned at all
   - Empty array
   - Confidence: 0.9
   - Value: []

3. **processing_paradigm**:
   - Mentions "data pipelines and workflows"
   - No specific streaming or batch technologies mentioned
   - Could be either, but no clear signals
   - Confidence: <0.5
   - Value: "not_mentioned"

4. **orchestrator_category**:
   - No specific orchestrator mentioned (no Airflow, etc.)
   - Palantir Foundry might have its own orchestration but not specified
   - Confidence: <0.5
   - Value: "not_mentioned"

5. **storage_layer**:
   - No specific data warehouse, lake, or lakehouse mentioned
   - Palantir Foundry manages data but storage specifics not detailed
   - Confidence: <0.5
   - Value: "not_mentioned"

**GEO AND WORK MODEL:**

1. **remote_restriction**:
   - Work model stated as "onsite"
   - Location: Berthoud, CO
   - This suggests same_location restriction
   - But the options are: same_country, same_timezone, same_region, anywhere
   - "same_region" would be most appropriate for onsite Berthoud, CO
   - Confidence: 0.8 (onsite requirement is clear)
   - Value: "same_region"

2. **timezone_focus**:
   - Location: Berthoud, CO (Mountain Time Zone)
   - No specific timezone requirements mentioned
   - Onsite role would naturally be in Mountain Time
   - Confidence: 0.7 (inferred from location)
   - Value: "specific_country" (US, but more specifically Colorado/Mountain region)

3. **relocation_required**:
   - Onsite role in Berthoud, CO
   - Must already be in location or willing to relocate
   - No relocation package mentioned
   - This suggests relocation would be required for non-locals
   - Confidence: 0.8
   - Value: true

**VISA AND AUTHORIZATION:**

1. **h1b_friendly**:

   - Value: []

**REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION:**

1. **requirement_strictness**:
   - Clear "Required Qualifications" vs "Desired Experience" sections
   - Mix of must-haves and nice-to-haves
   - Not extremely strict, but has clear requirements
   - Confidence: 0.7
   - Value: "medium"

2. **scope_definition**:
   - Focused job description on Software & Data Engineer role
   - Clear responsibilities around Palantir Foundry
   - Not a multi-role hybrid position
   - Confidence: 0.8
   - Value: "clear"

3. **skill_inflation_detected**:
   - 1-5 years experience for this role seems reasonable
   - Skills listed are appropriate for the level
   - No unrealistic expectations
   - Confidence: 0.8
   - Value: false

Let me double-check my confidence levels and make sure I'm following the rules:

- Only infer with confidence >= 0.5
- Every field must have value + confidence + evidence + source
- Source must be one of: "pass1_derived" | "inferred" | "combined"
- Never guess - use "not_mentioned" when unclear

Looking at my analysis, I have a few fields with confidence < 0.5 that I should set to "not_mentioned":
- primary_cloud: <0.5 → "not_mentioned"
- processing_paradigm: <0.5 → "not_mentioned" 


- orchestrator_category: <0.5 → "not_mentioned"
- storage_layer: <0.5 → "not_mentioned"

I'll mark these additional fields as "not_mentioned" to ensure I maintain the required confidence threshold and provide clear, accurate information about the job posting's technical specifications.
