<reasoning>Let me analyze this Korean job posting for MUSINSA (a Korean fashion company) for a Data Engineer position. I need to carefully examine both the original posting and the Pass 1 extraction results to make inferences about various job characteristics.

First, let me understand what I know from the Pass 1 extraction:
- Location: Seoul, South Korea (onsite only)
- Employment: Full-time, permanent contract
- Must-have skills: SQL, Python, data modeling, data extraction, data processing, data quality management, workflow management, Airflow, Luigi, Dagster, Prefect
- Nice-to-have: data quality frameworks, Great Expectations, Soda, Databricks, data warehouse development
- Soft skills: Problem Solving, Communication, Team Collaboration
- No salary information disclosed
- No visa sponsorship mentioned
- No benefits mentioned
- No specific years of experience required
- No education requirements
- No certifications mentioned

Now let me analyze each inference category:

**Seniority and Role:**
- Title: "Data Engineer (모델링)" - this suggests a data engineer with modeling focus
- No specific years mentioned, but the role seems to be at a mid to senior level based on the complexity of responsibilities
- Job family: Clearly data_engineer based on title and responsibilities
- Sub specialty: The role mentions data modeling, data quality management, workflow management - this suggests batch_etl and data_modeling focus
- Leadership: No mention of direct reports or team leadership, seems like an IC role

**Stack and Cloud:**
- Primary cloud: Not explicitly mentioned in the text, but Databricks is mentioned which could be on any cloud
- Processing paradigm: Mentions CDC (Change Data Capture), user behavior events, search data - this suggests both batch and streaming capabilities
- Orchestrator: Airflow, Luigi, Dagster, Prefect are all mentioned - this is clearly airflow_like category
- Storage: Mentions data warehouse development and Databricks - could be warehouse or lakehouse

**Geo and Work Model:**
- Remote restriction: "same_country" - must be in Seoul, South Korea


- Timezone: "specific_country" - South Korea
- Relocation: Not applicable since it's already in Seoul

**Visa and Authorization:**
- H1B: Not applicable (Korean company, Korean location)
- OPT/CPT: Not applicable (Korean location)
- Citizenship: Likely "work_auth_only" for South Korea

**Contract and Compensation:**
- W2 vs 1099: Likely "w2" for Korean full-time employment
- Benefits: "none_mentioned" - no benefits listed

**Career Development:**
- Growth path: Vague mentions of growth but no specific tracks
- Mentorship: Implied through team collaboration
- Promotion: Not mentioned
- Internal mobility: Not mentioned
- Career tracks: Not specified

**Requirements Classification:**
- Requirement strictness: Medium - clear must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- Scope definition: Clear - focused data engineering role
- Skill inflation: No - reasonable requirements for the role

I'll focus on the nuanced details of this data engineering position, highlighting the specific technical requirements and role characteristics that define the opportunity.
