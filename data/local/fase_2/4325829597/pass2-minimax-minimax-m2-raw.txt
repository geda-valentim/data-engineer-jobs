Now let me go through each inference category:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE

### seniority_level
- Title: "Go Anywhere SFTP Data Engineer" - no explicit seniority in title
- Experience: 3-5 years minimum
- Responsibilities: Managing data pipelines, SFTP operations, incident management, on-call duties
- This suggests mid-level to senior level
- 3-5 years is typically mid-level in data engineering
- But the responsibilities (incident management, on-call, SOC controls) suggest more senior responsibilities


- I'll classify this as a mid-level position with potential for growth
- The role requires significant technical expertise and operational responsibility
- Mid-level seems most appropriate given the experience range and job complexity

### job_family
- Clearly a data engineer role
- Focus on data pipelines, ingestion, processing
- SFTP data transfer specialization
- Data engineering is the primary job family

### sub_specialty
