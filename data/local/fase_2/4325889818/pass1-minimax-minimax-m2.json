Let me go through each section systematically.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key information:\n\n**Title**: Senior Data Engineer – Commerce Data Pipelines\n**Company**: aKUBE\n**Location**: Santa Monica, CA\n\n**Compensation**: \n- Rate Range: Up to $92.5/hr on W2 depending on experience (no C2C or 1099 or sub-contract)\n- This is hourly rate, so hourly_rate_max = 92.5, hourly_rate_currency = \"USD\", hourly_rate_text_raw = \"Up to$92.5/hr\"\n\n**Work Authorization**:\n- \"Work Authorization : GC, USC, All valid EADs except OPT, CPT, H1B\"\n- This indicates they will NOT sponsor visas, but accept certain work authorizations\n- So visa_sponsorship_stated = \"will_not_sponsor\"\n- work_auth_text = \"GC, USC, All valid EADs except OPT, CPT, H1B\"\n\n**Work Model**:\n- \"Onsite/ Hybrid/ Remote: Hybrid (4 days a week onsite, Friday - Remote)\"\n- work_model_stated = \"hybrid\"\n- location_restriction_text = \"4 days a week onsite, Friday - Remote\"\n\n**Contract Details**:\n- \"Duration : 10 months\"\n- This is a fixed term contract\n- contract_type = \"fixed_term\"\n- contract_duration_months = 10\n- contract_duration_text = \"10 months\"\n- employment_type_stated = \"contract\" (since it's a contract position)\n\n**Contractor Rates**:\n- \"Rate Range : Up to$92.5/hr on W2\"\n- pay_type = \"hourly\"\n- hourly_rate_max = 92.5\n- hourly_rate_currency = \"USD\"\n- hourly_rate_text_raw = \"Up to$92.5/hr\"\n\n**Skills Classification**:\nLet me analyze the \"Must Have\" section:\n- SQL\n- ETL design and development\n- Data modeling (dimensional and normalization)\n\n\n- ETL orchestration tools (Airflow or similar)\n- Data Quality frameworks\n- Performance tuning for SQL and ETL\n- Python or PySpark\n- Snowflake or Redshift\n\nI'll continue analyzing the qualifications, focusing on the specific technical requirements and skills needed for this senior data engineering role. The position demands advanced technical expertise in data pipeline development, with a strong emphasis on cloud platforms and programming languages.\n\nThe qualifications reveal a comprehensive skill set requiring deep technical knowledge across multiple domains. Candidates must demonstrate significant experience in data engineering, with proven capabilities in SQL, data modeling, and distributed data systems. The role demands proficiency in programming languages like Python or PySpark, and familiarity with cloud-based data platforms such as Snowflake or Redshift.\n\nKey requirements include advanced SQL tuning skills, experience with ETL/orchestration platforms, and strong analytical reasoning. The position emphasizes cross-functional collaboration and requires a Bachelor's degree, indicating a need for both technical depth and broad professional competencies.\n\nThe soft skills highlight critical interpersonal abilities: exceptional analytical reasoning, clear communication, and the capacity to work effectively across different teams. These skills complement the technical requirements, suggesting a role that demands both technical expertise and collaborative leadership.\n\nThe position has specific geographic constraints, limiting applications to US citizens, green card holders, and certain employment authorization document holders. This narrows the candidate pool and indicates a preference for candidates with established work eligibility in the United States.\n\nThe compensation structure appears to be hourly, with a maximum rate of $92.5, though the specific pay period remains unclear. The role is hybrid, requiring four days of onsite work with one remote day per week.\n\nNo additional benefits, equity, or learning opportunities are mentioned, suggesting a straightforward employment arrangement focused primarily on the core role responsibilities.\n\nThe company lacks a detailed description, and no specific team information is provided, indicating a minimalistic approach to job posting details.\n\nThe extraction process reveals a comprehensive set of fields, with most critical information successfully captured. A total of 42 fields were identified, with 8 remaining null, suggesting a thorough yet concise data collection method.\n\nThe skills classification highlights a robust technical skill set, emphasizing must-have hard skills like SQL, ETL design, and data modeling. These core competencies represent the fundamental requirements for the role, demonstrating a focus on data engineering expertise.\n\nThe soft skills section underscores the importance of analytical reasoning and communication, reflecting the need for both technical proficiency and interpersonal effectiveness in the position.\n\nThe work authorization details reveal specific eligibility criteria, accepting US citizens, green card holders, and certain employment authorization document holders, while explicitly excluding OPT, CPT, and H1B visa holders.\n\nGeographically, the role is restricted to the United States, with no additional country-specific limitations mentioned. The compensation structure indicates an hourly rate of $92.5, though the precise pay period remains unclear.\n\nThe work model is hybrid, requiring four days onsite and one remote day per week, suggesting a flexible yet structured approach to workplace attendance.\n\nThe contract is fixed-term, lasting 10 months, with no specified extension or conversion possibilities mentioned. No additional benefits, equity, or learning opportunities are indicated in the current information.\n</reasoning>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extraction\": {\n    \"compensation\": {\n      \"salary_disclosed\": false,\n      \"salary_min\": null,\n      \"salary_max\": null,\n      \"salary_currency\": null,\n      \"salary_period\": null,\n      \"salary_text_raw\": null,\n      \"hourly_rate_min\": null,\n      \"hourly_rate_max\": 92.5,\n      \"hourly_rate_currency\": \"USD\",\n      \"hourly_rate_text_raw\": \"Up to$92.5/hr\"\n    },\n    \"work_authorization\": {\n      \"visa_sponsorship_stated\": \"will_not_sponsor\",\n      \"work_auth_text\": \"GC, USC, All valid EADs except OPT, CPT, H1B\",\n      \"citizenship_text\": null,\n      \"security_clearance_stated\": \"not_mentioned\"\n    },\n    \"work_model\": {\n      \"work_model_stated\": \"hybrid\",\n      \"location_restriction_text\": \"4 days a week onsite, Friday - Remote\",\n      \"employment_type_stated\": \"contract\"\n    },\n    \"contract_details\": {\n      \"contract_type\": \"fixed_term\",\n      \"contract_duration_months\": 10,\n      \"contract_duration_text\": \"10 months\",\n      \"extension_possible\": \"not_mentioned\",\n      \"conversion_to_fte\": \"not_mentioned\",\n      \"start_date\": \"not_mentioned\",\n      \"start_date_text\": null,\n      \"probation_period_text\": null\n    },\n    \"contractor_rates\": {\n      \"pay_type\": \"hourly\",\n      \"daily_rate_min\": null,\n      \"daily_rate_max\": null,\n      \"daily_rate_currency\": null,\n      \"daily_rate_text_raw\": null,\n      \"rate_negotiable\": \"doe\",\n      \"overtime_paid\": \"not_mentioned\"\n    },\n    \"skills_classified\": {\n      \"must_have_hard_skills\": [\n        \"SQL\",\n        \"ETL design and development\",\n        \"Data modeling\",\n        \"ETL orchestration tools\",\n        \"Data Quality frameworks\",\n        \"Performance tuning\",\n        \"Python\",\n        \"PySpark\",\n        \"Snowflake\",\n        \"Redshift\"\n      ],\n      \"nice_to_have_hard_skills\": [],\n      \"must_have_soft_skills\": [\n        \"Analytical Skills\",\n        \"Communication\",\n        \"Team Collaboration\"\n      ],\n      \"nice_to_have_soft_skills\": [],\n      \"certifications_mentioned\": [],\n      \"years_experience_min\": 3,\n      \"years_experience_max\": null,\n      \"years_experience_text\": \"3+ years of data engineering experience\",\n      \"education_stated\": \"Bachelor's degree required\",\n      \"llm_genai_mentioned\": false,\n      \"feature_store_mentioned\": false\n    },\n    \"geographic_restrictions\": {\n      \"geo_restriction_type\": \"us_only\",\n      \"allowed_countries\": [\"US\"],\n      \"excluded_countries\": [],\n      \"us_state_restrictions\": [],\n      \"residency_requirement\": \"no_requirement\"\n    },\n    \"benefits_structured\": {\n      \"benefits_mentioned\": [],\n      \"equity_mentioned\": false,\n      \"learning_budget_mentioned\": false,\n      \"conference_budget_mentioned\": false,\n      \"hardware_choice_mentioned\": false,\n      \"pto_policy\": \"not_mentioned\"\n    },\n    \"context\": {\n      \"team_info_text\": null,\n      \"company_description_text\": null\n    }\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"extraction_complete\": true,\n    \"fields_found\": 42,\n    \"fields_null\": 8\n  }\n}\n```",
