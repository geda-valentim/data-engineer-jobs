Now let me make inferences following the rules:

## SENIORITY AND ROLE INFERENCE

### seniority_level
- Title explicitly says "Senior Data Engineer"
- 4+ years experience required
- This maps to "senior" level in the IC hierarchy
- Confidence: 0.9+ (explicit title + experience match)

### job_family
- Title is "Data Engineer"
- Core responsibilities are data pipelines, orchestration, storage
- This is clearly "data_engineer"
- Confidence: 0.95+ (explicit title match)

### sub_specialty
- Mentions both batch (ETL/ELT, scheduled pipelines) and streaming (Kafka, Kinesis as nice-to-have)


- Primary focus appears to be batch processing with modern data lake technologies
- The role emphasizes data infrastructure and pipeline management
- Suggests a hybrid approach to data processing, balancing batch and streaming capabilities
- Confidence: 0.75 (mixed signals but batch-focused)

### leadership_expectation
- Senior role suggests technical leadership
- Mentions contributing to team formation and practices
- No direct reports mentioned
- This points to "tech_lead_ic" - technical leadership without people management
- Confidence: 0.75 (senior level implies tech leadership)

## STACK AND CLOUD INFERENCE

### primary_cloud
- AWS explicitly mentioned multiple times (AWS Athena, CloudFormation)
- Also mentions Azure and GCP as alternatives
- But AWS is the primary focus with specific services
- Confidence: 0.9+ (AWS explicitly mentioned as primary)

### secondary_clouds
- Azure and GCP mentioned as alternatives to AWS
- These would be secondary options
- Confidence: 0.8 (mentioned as alternatives)

### processing_paradigm
- Strong emphasis on batch processing (ETL/ELT, scheduled pipelines)
- Streaming mentioned as nice-to-have (Kafka, Kinesis)
- Primary focus is batch with streaming as enhancement
- Confidence: 0.8 (batch-focused with streaming nice-to-have)

### orchestrator_category
- Multiple orchestrators mentioned: Dagster, Airflow, Prefect
- This suggests a modern orchestrator approach
- "dagster_prefect" category fits best given the mention of multiple modern tools
- Confidence: 0.85 (multiple modern orchestrators mentioned)

### storage_layer
- Mentions "datalake technologies"
- AWS Athena suggests data warehouse capabilities
- Iceberg format mentioned suggests lakehouse architecture
- This points to "lakehouse" - modern data lake with warehouse capabilities
- Confidence: 0.8 (lakehouse technologies mentioned)

## GEO AND WORK MODEL INFERENCE

### remote_restriction
- Hybrid model: 2 core days in Boston office (Tuesday/Wednesday)
- This requires being in the Boston area
- "same_region" fits - must be in Boston metro area
- Confidence: 0.85 (hybrid model requires regional presence)

### timezone_focus
- Boston, MA location
- No specific timezone requirements mentioned
- Would default to Eastern Time given Boston location
- "specific_country" doesn't fit as no country restriction mentioned
- "not_mentioned" is most accurate since no timezone overlap requirements stated
- Confidence: 0.7 (location known but no timezone requirements)

### relocation_required
- Hybrid model requires being in Boston area
- No mention of relocation packages or moving assistance
- "must already be in [location]" fits - already need to be in Boston area
- Confidence: 0.8 (hybrid model implies local presence required)

## VISA AND AUTHORIZATION INFERENCE

### h1b_friendly
- Pass 1 shows "not_mentioned" for visa sponsorship
- No explicit mention of H1B sponsorship
- Default assumption would be not friendly unless stated otherwise
- Confidence: 0.7 (not mentioned = likely not friendly)

### opt_cpt_friendly
- No mention of student visa support
- Standard work authorization requirements implied
- "work authorization required" suggests no student visa support
- Confidence: 0.75 (standard requirements suggest no student visas)

### citizenship_required
- No citizenship requirements mentioned
- "Authorized to work in US" would be the standard requirement
- "work_auth_only" fits best
- Confidence: 0.8 (standard work authorization requirement)

## CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION INFERENCE

### w2_vs_1099
- Full-time employee position
- Benefits package mentioned (medical, retirement, equity)
- This clearly indicates W2 employment
- Confidence: 0.9 (full-time with benefits = W2)

### benefits_level
- Comprehensive package: medical, retirement, lifestyle benefits
- Equity mentioned
- Annual bonus program
- Free SimpliSafe system
- ERGs
- This goes beyond standard - multiple premium benefits
- "comprehensive" fits best
- Confidence: 0.85 (multiple premium benefits mentioned)

## CAREER DEVELOPMENT INFERENCE

### growth_path_clarity
- Mentions "learning and growth are continuous"
- "Collaborative and agile environment where learning and growth are continuous"
- No specific career tracks mentioned
- This is "implied" - growth mentioned but not specific paths
- Confidence: 0.7 (growth mentioned but not specific)

### mentorship_signals
- Mentions "learning and growth are continuous"
- Collaborative environment
- Contributing to team formation
- No formal mentorship program mentioned
- "implied" fits - working with experienced team members
- Confidence: 0.7 (collaborative learning environment)

### promotion_path_mentioned
- No explicit promotion or advancement paths mentioned
- No "path to", "grow to", "move to" language
- This would be "false"
- Confidence: 0.8 (no promotion language used)

### internal_mobility_mentioned
- No mention of internal transfers, lateral moves, exploring roles
- Team formation mentioned but not mobility between teams
- This would be "false"
- Confidence: 0.8 (no mobility language used)

### career_tracks_available
- Senior role suggests IC track progression
- No management track mentioned
- No specialist or architect tracks mentioned
- Only "ic_track" can be inferred
- Confidence: 0.6 (senior level implies IC progression)

## REQUIREMENTS CLASSIFICATION INFERENCE

### requirement_strictness
- Clear distinction between "must have" and "nice to have"
- Strong knowledge required for core skills
- Mix of required and preferred qualifications
- This suggests "medium" strictness
- Confidence: 0.75 (balanced must-have vs nice-to-have)

### scope_definition
- Focused job description on data engineering
- Clear responsibilities around data pipelines and infrastructure
- Single clear role, not multi-role hybrid
- "clear" fits best
- Confidence: 0.85 (focused, well-defined role)

### skill_inflation_detected
- Senior level with senior requirements (4+ years, advanced technical skills)
- Requirements seem reasonable for senior data engineer
- No unrealistic combinations or excessive years for level
- This would be "false"
- Confidence: 0.8 (reasonable requirements for seniority level)
