Now let me make inferences for each category:

**1. SENIORITY AND ROLE:**
- **seniority_level**: The title explicitly says "Senior Data Engineer" and requires 3+ years. This is a clear match for senior level. Confidence: 0.95
- **job_family**: This is clearly a data engineer role focused on pipelines, ETL, data modeling. Confidence: 0.95


- **sub_specialty**: The role centers on batch ETL processes, utilizing Airflow for orchestration and working with Snowflake/Redshift warehouses. Confidence: 0.90
- **leadership_expectation**: While a senior position, the role lacks explicit management responsibilities, suggesting a technical individual contributor path. Confidence: 0.80

**2. STACK AND CLOUD:**
- **primary_cloud**: The job description doesn't specify a cloud provider, leaving the primary cloud undefined. Confidence: 0.50
- **secondary_clouds**: No additional cloud platforms are mentioned, resulting in an empty array. Confidence: 0.90
- **processing_paradigm**: The focus is on batch ETL processes, with no indication of streaming capabilities. Confidence: 0.85
- **orchestrator_category**: Airflow is explicitly mentioned, categorizing this as an Airflow-like workflow. Confidence: 0.95
- **storage_layer**: The role involves working with Snowflake and Redshift, indicating a warehouse-centric approach. Confidence: 0.90

**3. GEO AND WORK MODEL:**
- **remote_restriction**: The hybrid model requires 4 days onsite, suggesting a location-specific constraint. Confidence: 0.85
- **timezone_focus**: The role appears to be US-focused, with locations in Seattle, Santa Monica, and NYC. Confidence: 0.80
- **relocation_required**: The onsite requirement implies potential relocation needs for non-local candidates. Confidence: 0.75

**4. VISA AND AUTHORIZATION:**
- **h1b_friendly**: The work authorization explicitly excludes H1B visa holders. Confidence: 0.95
- **opt_cpt_friendly**: Student visa holders are not permitted for this position. Confidence: 0.90
- **citizenship_required**: The role requires work authorization, suggesting openness to various immigration statuses. Confidence: 0.85

**5. CONTRACT AND COMPENSATION:**
- **w2_vs_1099**: The position is strictly W2, with no alternative contract arrangements. Confidence: 0.95
- **benefits_level**: No specific benefits are outlined in the job description. Confidence: 0.90
